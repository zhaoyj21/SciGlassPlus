       "[['The present work was conducted to establish an initial understanding of the processing-microstructure-property relations for gamma-TiAl manufactured by electron beam powder bed fusion. The investigation included microstructure characterization at different length scales of near-g titanium aluminide Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb (in atom pct) in addition to evaluating the compressive strength, microstructures, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth behavior. Micro-CT revealed significant variations in the spatial distribution of internal defects along the build of the as-deposited sample, while HIP reduced these defects. However, inhomogeneous microstructures were exhibited in both the as-deposited and HIP materials while HIP processing reduced both the yield strength and amount of scatter in mechanical properties. Despite these observations, fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth results were in the range of those reported for conventionally cast material. The use of cloud computing provided an efficient means for data management, microstructure analytics, and collaboration among various contributors to the work. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

       " ['Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic parts is a relatively new manufacturing procedure. Many industry sectors, such as the aerospace or automotive sectors, have started to apply this technology to produce some elements, thus reducing costs and weight. Several metallic alloys have been employed for AM. Due to the high strength-to-density ratio, Ti6Al4V alloy is probably the alloy most used for AM in the aerospace industry. This alloy usually shows good static strength properties. However, the presence of internal defects and the surface roughness result in a fatigue strength that is clearly lower than that of materials produced by traditional processes. Moreover, the scatter of the fatigue results is generally higher than in the case of wrought pieces.Different treatments have been proposed to improve the fatigue behavior by reducing internal defects and roughness or generating a favorable residual stress field. In this work, selected surface treatments were considered to improve the fatigue strength of AM parts, including shot and laser peening as well as a combination of shot peening plus chemical assisted surface enhancement (CASE (R)). Three groups of specimens, each with one of the surface treatments, were fatigue tested to compare the results produced by these treatments. The residual stresses, roughness and hardness produced by the treatments were analyzed. After testing, the fracture surfaces were also analyzed to better understand the fatigue process of the different groups of specimens. The results indicate that laser peening produced the best results, followed by shot peening plus CASE and shot peening. In all three cases, the fatigue strength was much higher than that of the reference group without surface treatment. It was also observed that all failures initiated from an interior defect in the shot peening plus CASE group, four out of six failures in the laser peened group, but only one failure in the case of shot peened group and none in the reference group. Failures of specimens with initiation from internal defects started from defects located deeper than the compressive residual stress layer produced by the treatments.',\n",

       " ['Additive manufacturing is extending its influence on various modern industries, including automobile, aerospace, aviation, and maritime. This is specifically true for selective laser melting since it is capable of manufacturing dense parts from metal and alloy powders. Thus, the performance of materials processed by selective laser melting has become the focus of many studies recently. However, their fatigue endurance is yet to be understood comprehensively, and few studies have been carried out on this topic thus far. The lack of understanding is often attributed to the considerable number of manufacturing parameters, which also hinders employing selective laser melting for typical industrial applications. Among the various materials processed by selective laser melting, steel is one of the most attractive ones to manufacturers due to its broad range of properties and applications. This paper aims to describe the studies carried out on the fatigue properties of diverse types of steel manufactured by selective laser melting. It also reviews the parameters which are recognized to be effective on the fatigue behaviour of these steels. These parameters include building orientation, heat treatment, surface quality, energy density, and service condition of the final product. Recent studies on selective laser melting along with the variety of its influential parameters on the fatigue strength highlight a knowledge gap towards reaching a comprehensive understanding of the fatigue behaviour of steels manufactured by this process. Based on this fact, some of these gaps are discussed as the potential topics for the future studies in the field of additive manufacturing at the end of this review.',\n",

Jetlag is mostly self-managed by the individual. The most effective strategies require individuals to make behavioral changes to carefully alter sleep-wake schedules and time light exposure. However, travelers' perceptions, including their experiences, beliefs about jetlag/travel fatigue, and management expectations remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to systematically synthesize the literature to understand what is currently known about travelers' perceptions of jetlag and travel fatigue. A literature search was conducted through EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus generating 1164 results (2 articles known to authors), which were screened against our inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies including data from 3952 participants were evaluated for its study design and traveler-centered outcome measures across the domains of: 1) Traveler Health Beliefs and Knowledge about Jetlag and Travel Fatigue; 2) Experience of Jetlag and Travel Fatigue 3) Traveler Priorities; 4) Self-reported Management Strategies for Jetlag and Travel Fatigue; and 5) User Experiences of Management Strategies. Synthesis of results suggests a potential mismatch between researchers' focus on circadian misalignment and travelers' focus on air travel comfort. A better understanding of the beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, satisfaction, experiences, and expectations about jetlag and travel fatigue will better enable the development of interventions that align with traveler priorities.\",\n",

Lenses available to meet these challenges include liquid crystal (LC) lenses, which possess a response time in the millisecond range. This response time is slow, while accessing multiple focal lengths. A ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) has a response time in the microsecond range. In this article, we disclose a switchable lens device having a combination of the fast FLC-based polarization rotation unit and a passive polarization-dependent LC lens. A cascaded combination of three such lens units allows access to eight different focal points quite rapidly and can be a convenient device for VR applications.

Particularly, the applicability of Murakami's model for predicting the fatigue limit at ET was examined. Microstructure observations revealed that the AM Ti-6Al-4V alloy had acicular alpha + beta microstructures while the conventionally manufactured (CM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy had equiaxed alpha phases in beta matrix. Round-shaped defects and crevice-liked sharp defects with the size of up to 50 mu m were observed in the AM Ti-6Al-4V, which were not observed in the CM Ti-6Al-4V. The fatigue strengths at 10(7) cycles of the CM Ti-6Al-4V were 625 MPa at RT and 475 MPa at ET, and those of the AM Ti-6Al-4V were 300 MPa at RT and 250 MPa at ET. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the fracture surfaces revealed that fatigue cracks in the AM Ti-6Al-4V specimens initiated from defects at ET as well as they did at RT. The fatigue strengths of the AM Ti-6Al-4V at RT and at ET were evaluated by Murakami's model and the predicted value agreed well with the experimental value.\",\n",

       " ['Cold spray coating is gaining increasing attention as a solid state additive technique for repairing structural components. The fatigue behavior of Al 6082 cold spray coating with the same material as substrate is studied. Furthermore, the possibility of improving the load bearing capacity of the cold spray coated specimens by shot peening process is explored. Conventional and severe shot peening were applied before and after cold spray depositions. The coated, coated-peened and peened-coated specimens were characterized by optical microscopy observation, surface roughness and X-ray diffraction residual stress measurements. The specimens were subjected to rotating bending fatigue tests in order to determine the fatigue strength. Unlike the fixed-cantilever, constant-deflection thin specimens, often used to measure fatigue strength of cold spray coatings, the present approach does not considerably reduce the applied stress at the interface compared to the nominal stress and thus represents a more critical and realistic response of the coatings to fatigue loading conditions. The fractured surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Cold spray coating increased the fatigue strength by 15% compared to the as-received specimens. Further improvement was achieved by the hybrid peening and coating treatment. It was found that shot peening is more efficient if it is performed prior to cold spray deposition. A 26% improvement in the fatigue strength was obtained by performing severe shot peening prior to cold spray deposition. This improvement was attributed to the integrity of coating/substrate interface without any signs of delamination, crack initiation from the surface instead of the interface, crack propagation mainly by transcrystalline mechanism and not through particle boundaries and finally high depth of compressive residual stresses.

Even though BMGs with low glass forming abilities (GFA) can potentially be manufactured via AM, the resultant build undergoes partial devitrification, structural relaxation, cracking, or picks up oxygen (O). O pick-up is a serious issue for AM fabricated BMGs as it causes embrittlement and affects its potential use as a structural material. Here, a detailed review of the O pick-up in BMGs during AM fabrication is provided. The effect of O on the propensity of crystal nuclei formation and the glass forming ability of BMGs is critically discussed. Thereafter, the effect of on the mechanical properties of BMGs, and how it affects its structural performance are reviewed. Above a certain threshold, which could be composition-specific, O improves the strength of the BMG but diminishes its fracture, fatigue, and plasticity. These discussions will lead to the formulation of some future directions of research in AM fabrication of BMGs that have both scientific and technological relevance.',\n",

Many materials are used for 3D printing; however, as the most used material in fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) offers good mechanical properties. It is perfect for making structures for industrial applications in complex environments. Three-dimensional printing parameters, including building orientation, layers thickness, and nozzle size, critically affect the crack growth in FDM structures under complex loads. Therefore, this paper used the dynamic bending vibration test to investigate their influence on fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate under dynamic loads and the Paris power law constant C and m. The paper proposed an analytical solution to determine the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip based on the measurement of structural dynamic response. The experimental results show that the lower ambient temperature, as well as increased nozzle size and layer thickness, provide a lower FCG rate. The printing orientation, which is the same as loading, also slows the crack growth. The linear regression between these parameters and Paris Law's coefficient also proves the same conclusion.\",\n",

Most people ingest trace amounts of proanthocyanidins through foods such as red wine and cranberry juice. However, the functional properties of proanthocyanidins have been little understood. Since 1983, we have studied the antioxidative functions, preventive actions on diseases and utilization of proanthocyanidins. The antioxidative activities of proanthocyanidins were found to be much stronger than vitamin C or vitamin E in aqueous systems. The mechanisms for their antioxidative actions were shown to involve radical scavenging, quenching, and enzyme-inhibiting actions. The preventive actions of proanthcyanidins on diseases relating to reactive oxygen species was examined using animal tests. Proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract was showed to have preventive actions on diseases such as atherosclerosis, gastric ulcer, large bowel cancer, cataracts and diabetes. In human intervention trials, grape seed extract was shown to have preventive effects on the increase in lipid peroxides in human plasma after exercise and on muscle fatigue after training. The uses and manufacturing techniques of proanthocyanidin products were subsequently developed.

However, mutually opposing requirements of porous architecture and mechanical strength in conjunction with the high energy absorption capability have restricted their use. Here, we illustrate that electron beam melting can fabricate functionally graded Ti-6Al-4V alloy interconnected mesh structures with a combination of low density (0.5-2 g/cm(3)), high fatigue strength (similar to 70 MPa) and energy absorption (similar to 50 MJ/mg), which is superior to the ordinary uniform cellular structures. The underlying fundamental mechanisms governing the compressive and fatigue behavior of the graded cellular structures are elucidated via in situ tomography experiments and digital volume correlation analyses. It is underscored that during cyclic deformation, the stress can be continuously redistributed because of inhomogeneous mechanical properties and crack formation in constituent meshes, thereby resulting in variation of cyclic ratcheting rate for the graded cellular structures.

FFF is highly flexible, robust and uses stable and easily transportable precursor materials. Although the static mechanical properties of FFF components are well documented, the dynamic mechanical properties are still not fully established. It was identified that raster orientation was a significant factor in determining tensile strength, and thus could also affect fatigue strength. Dogbone specimens of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were tested under sinusoidal tension-tension fatigue loading at a frequency of 5 Hz, and at 40%, 60%, 80% and 90% of the mean ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the respective - 45 degrees/45 degrees and 0 degrees/90 degrees raster orientations determined from static tensile tests. Sample sizes of 5 were used for each stress level. Statistical analysis of the results showed that the two raster orientations fail at a statistically equivalent number of cycles when fatigued at the same percentage of UTS. However, when tested at the same absolute stress, the - 45 degrees/45 degrees raster orientation exhibited a greater number of cycles to failure by as much as 63.5%. A linear fatigue model was derived for each raster orientation based on a single static test which has the potential to simplify component design and testing requirements.',\n",

Art-making involves creating art or craft alone or in a group and does not require an art-therapist as the emphasis is on creativity rather than an overt therapeutic intention. An integrative review was undertaken of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method studies on art-making for people who have cancer, at any stage of treatment or recovery. An adapted version of Kaplan's Attention Restoration Theory (ART) was used to interpret the themes found in the literature. Fifteen studies were reviewed. Nine concerned art-making programmes and six were focused on individual, non-facilitated art-making. Review results suggested that programme-based art-making may provide participants with opportunities for learning about self, support, enjoyment and distraction. Individual art-making can provides learning about self, diversion and pleasure, self-management of pain, a sense of control, and enhanced social relationships. When viewed through the lens of ART, art-making can be understood as an energy-restoring activity that has the potential to enhance the lives of people with a diagnosis of cancer.\",\n",

Graphene and its derivatives with extraordinary advantages are highly attractive precursors. However, it is difficult to assemble graphene into macroscopic cubes with good fatigue resistance performance. Here, we propose an efficient way to manufacture a lamellar-structural rGO aerogel with enhanced stiffness and deflection of lamellae, by using MXene as a rigidity additive. The addition of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) improves the mechanical and fatigue resistance properties of the aerogel, making it super compressible and elastic. The highly stable structure of the aerogel can withstand extremely high compressive strain of 90% and long-term compression at 50% strain for at least 10,000 cycles. The lamellar structure makes a great contribution to achieve good sensing performance including high linear sensitivity, low testing limit, wide testing strain range and quick response. These features make the MXene/rGO aerogel a promising sensing material for flexible wearable devices to monitor the subtle and obvious biosignals of the human body movement.',\n",

Materials and methods A search was conducted electronically in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Cochran Library databases, and also by other methods (table of contents screening, backward and forward citations, and grey literature search) up to February 12, 2022, to identify records evaluating additive manufacturing of ceramics for dental purposes in comparison with subtractive manufacturing. A minimum of 2 review authors conducted tstudy selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. Quality assessment was performed with Joanna Briggs Institute tool, and the quantitative synthesis was performed with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program (CMA, Biostat Inc). Hedges's g for effect size was calculated, with 0.2 as small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large. Heterogeneity was assessed with I-2 and prediction interval (PI) statistics. Publication bias was investigated with funnel plots and grey literature search. Certainty of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results A total of 28 studies were included for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis; 11 in vitro studies on accuracy, 1 in vivo study on color, and 16 in vitro studies on physical and mechanical properties. Meta-analysis showed overall higher accuracy for SM compared with AM, with medium effect size (0.679, CI: 0.173 to 1.185, p = 0.009) and also for marginal (g = 1.05, CI: 0.344 to 1.760, p = 0.004), occlusal (g = 2.24, CI: 0.718 to 3.766, p = 0.004), and total (g = 4.544, CI: -0.234 to 9.323, p = 0.062) with large effect size; whereas AM had higher accuracy than SM with small effect size for the external (g = -0.238, CI: -1.215 to 0.739), p = 0.633), and internal (g = -0.403, CI: -1.273 to 0.467, p = 0.364) surfaces. For technology, self-glazed zirconia protocol had the smallest effect size (g = -0.049, CI: -0.878 to 0.78, p = 0.907), followed by stereolithography (g = 0.305, CI: -0.289 to 0.9, p = 0.314), and digital light processing (g = 1.819, CI: 0.662 to 2.976, p = 0.002) technologies. Flexural strength was higher for ceramics made by SM in comparison to AM with large effect size (g = -2.868, CI: -4.371 to -1.365, p < 0.001). Only 1 study reported on color, favoring ceramics made through combined AM and SM. Conclusions Subtractive manufacturing had better overall accuracy, particularly for the marginal and occlusal areas, higher flexural strength, and more favorable hardness, fracture toughness, porosity, fatigue, and volumetric shrinkage; whereas AM had more favorable elastic modulus and wettability. Both methods had favorable biocompatibility. All studies on accuracy and mechanical properties were in vitro, with high heterogeneity and low to very low certainty of evidence.

For the evaluation of the fracture toughness, the inclined asymmetrical semi-circular specimen subjected to three points loading (IASCB) was used, allowing to cover a wide variety of Mode I and II combinations. The effectiveness of manufacturing crack-like notches via the SLS technique in metals was evaluated by comparing the obtained experimental results with the ones obtained with pre-cracks induced by fatigue loading. The investigation was carried out by using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique, that allowed the evaluation of the full displacement fields around the crack tip. The displacement field was then used to compute the stress intensity factors (SIFs) for various combinations of Mode I and II, via a fitting technique which relies on the Williams' model for the displacement. The SIFs obtained in this way were compared to the results obtained with the conventional critical load method. The results showed that the discrepancy between the two methods reduces by ranging from Mode I to Mode II loading condition. Finally, the experimental SIFs obtained by the two methods were described by the mixed mode local stress criterium.\",\n",

Among all AM methods, electron beam melting (EBM) shows the potential to make TiAl components with good mechanical properties and is used for low pressure turbine blades. The mechanical properties, including tensile and compression properties, fracture toughness, fatigue and creep properties of EBM TiAl are reviewed and compared to the conventionally fabricated alloys. Results show that the tensile strength of EBM alloys is higher than cast alloys, and other properties are comparable to the cast/forged alloys. The sensitivity of mechanical properties and microstructure to EBM processing parameters is presented. Issues including layered microstructure, anisotropy in mechanical properties, and fatigue failure from defects are also reviewed. Finally, some opportunities and challenges of EBM TiAl are identified.',\n",

       " [\"Technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs), embedded clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems are at the forefront of healthcare's technological revolution. These health information technologies (HIT) pose great promise to improve patient safety, reduce medication errors and increase operational efficiencies in healthcare organizations. However, despite the perceived benefits that these complex technologies offer, their associated risks must not be overlooked or disregarded (Borycki et al., 2012). The objective of this article is to answer the following questions: 1) What is the nature of errors caused by technology (i.e., technology-induced errors) and alert fatigue in healthcare? 2) Is there a relationship between alert fatigue and technology induced errors? 3) Do organizational strategies exist to address these problems and enhance patient safety? 4) Do technological recommendations exist to improve the current issues surrounding safety? To answer these questions a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework was conducted using the CINAHL (R), Web of Science (R), IEEE Xplore (R) and PubMed (R) databases. The search focused on English publications only, using the search terms Alert Fatigue and Technology Errors. Articles were iteratively assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in an inclusion of 36 articles in the final scoping review. Following this, a thematic analysis was conducted and the findings placed in a data extraction table. The results indicated that while HIT present a significant opportunity to streamline processes and reduce medication errors, there is a critical need to assess them from a patient safety and quality lens. Lastly, a novel conceptual tool was created, the Flow of Cognitive Processing Model. The model provides an iterative perspective and an insightful view into the cognitive realms of healthcare professionals in their interactions with HIT. By illustrating the complexities of healthcare providers from a humanistic lens, the model could guide HIT design, acquisitions and implementations to reduce alert fatigue and mitigate the introduction of technology-induced errors.\",\n",

The machining cracks were introduced by a wheel grinding process, which is the most common method for finishing ceramic components. A semicircular groove was made at the center of small bending specimens by the machining. The machined specimens were healed at various temperatures and times in air. The optimized crack-healing condition of the machined specimen was found to be a temperature of 1300 degrees C and a time of 1 h. The specimens healed by this condition exhibited almost the same strength as the smooth specimens that underwent the healing process. Moreover, the bending strength and fatigue limit of the machined and healed specimens were systematically investigated at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1300 degrees C. The heat-resistance temperature has been determined to be approximately 1000 degrees C. Also, the specimens exhibited high static and cyclic fatigue limits at temperatures of 800 degrees and 1000 degrees C. These results demonstrate that crack healing could be an effective method for improving the structural integrity and reducing the manufacturing costs of a Si3N4/SiC composite ceramic.',\n",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the biomechanics of the pelvis under different daily activities and to establish a functional evaluation methodology for the customized prostheses. For this purposes, finite element model of a healthy pelvis as well as a reconstructed pelvic model after type II+III resection were built for biomechanical study. The biomechanical performance of the healthy and reconstructed pelvic model was studied under routine activities including standing, knee bending, sitting down, standing up, walking, stair descent and stair ascent. Subsequently, the strength and stability of the prosthesis were evaluated under these activities. Results showed that, for the heathy pelvic model, the stresses were mainly concentrated around the upper part of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joint undergoing different activities, and the maximum stress occurred during stair ascent. As for the reconstructed pelvis, the stress distribution and the tendency of the maximum stress variation predicted for the bone part during all the activities were similar to those of the natural pelvic model, which indicated that the load transferring function of the reconstructed pelvis could be restored by the prosthesis. Moreover, the predicted maximum von Mises stress of the screws and prosthesis was below the fatigue strength of the 3D printed Ti-6Al-4V, which indicated the prosthesis can provide a reliable mechanical performance after implantation.',\n",

The case hardening steel 16MnCr5 is typically used and its material properties are well known and understood. However, the resulting material properties following the post-LPBF process sequence such as residual stress annealing, case hardening and hard finishing are widely unknown. This paper presents a study of processing 16MnCr5 with an EOS M270 LPBF-machine reaching 99.5 % relative density and above. The resulting microstructure and hardness of the material is examined. Furthermore, the tensile strength as well as the gear-specific tooth root carrying capacity are studied. The results are compared to a conventionally processed material via continuous casting. It is shown that residual stress annealing widely compensates material anisotropy following the LPBF process. Material hardness in the as-built condition is increased up to 21 % compared to a conventional material. The case hardening behavior shows a difference in the resulting case hardening depth in comparison to conventional material. The residual stresses measured at the surface after the case hardening show compressive stresses. Pulsator tests deliver a stress-cycle (S-N) curve from which the tooth root carrying capacity can be derived.',\n",

       " ['Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) is a valuable feature of electronic health records (EHRs) designed to improve quality and safety. However, due to the complexities of system design and inconsistent results, CDS tools may inadvertently increase alert fatigue and contribute to physician burnout. A/B testing, or rapid-cycle randomized tests, is a useful method that can be applied to the EHR in order to rapidly understand and iteratively improve design choices embedded within CDS tools. Objective: This paper describes how rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) embedded within EHRs can be used to quickly ascertain the superiority of potential CDS design changes to improve their usability, reduce alert fatigue, and promote quality of care. Methods: A multistep process combining tools from user-centered design, A/B testing, and implementation science was used to understand, ideate, prototype, test, analyze, and improve each candidate CDS. CDS engagement metrics (alert views, acceptance rates) were used to evaluate which CDS version is superior. Results: To demonstrate the impact of the process, 2 experiments are highlighted. First, after multiple rounds of usability testing, a revised CDS influenza alert was tested against usual care CDS in a rapid (similar to 6 weeks) RCT. The new alert text resulted in minimal impact on reducing firings per patients per day, but this failure triggered another round of review that identified key technical improvements (ie, removal of dismissal button and firings in procedural areas) that led to a dramatic decrease in firings per patient per day (23.1 to 7.3). In the second experiment, the process was used to test 3 versions (financial, quality, regulatory) of text supporting tobacco cessation alerts as well as 3 supporting images. Based on 3 rounds of RCTs, there was no significant difference in acceptance rates based on the framing of the messages or addition of images. Conclusions: These experiments support the potential for this new process to rapidly develop, deploy, and rigorously evaluate CDS within an EHR. We also identified important considerations in applying these methods. This approach may be an important tool for improving the impact of and experience with CDS.',\n",

They were given autonomy to use funds for operational costs and performance bonuses. This study aims to understand changes in perceived motivation among health workers with the introduction of PBF in Wamba district, Nigeria. Methods: The study used a qualitative research design to compare perceptions of health workers in facilities receiving PBF payments in the pilot district of Wamba to those that were not. In-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 39) were conducted with health workers from PBF and non-PBF facilities along with managers of the PBF project. Framework analysis was used to identify patterns and variations in responses. Facility records were collated and triangulated with qualitative data. Findings: Health workers receiving PBF payments reported to be 'awakened' by performance bonuses and improved working environments including routine supportive supervision and availability of essential drugs. They recounted being more punctual, hard working and proud of providing better services to their communities. In comparison, health workers in non-PBF facilities complained about the dearth of basic equipment and lack of motivating strategies. However, health workers from both sets of facilities considered there to be a severe shortage of manpower resulting in excessive workload, fatigue and general dissatisfaction. Conclusions: PBF strategies can succeed in motivating health workers by bringing about a change in incentives and working conditions. However, such programmes need to be aligned with human resource reforms including timely recruitment and appropriate distribution of health workers to prevent burn out and attrition. As people working on the frontline of constrained health systems, health workers are responsive to improved incentives and working conditions, but need more comprehensive support.\",\n",

The mats were composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) mesh and lidocaine-, estradiol-, metronidazole-, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)-incorporated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanofibers that mimic the structure of the natural extracellular matrix of most connective tissues. The mechanical properties of degradable prolapse membrane were assessed and compared to commercial non-degradable polypropylene knitted meshes clinically used for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair. The release behaviors of the drug-loaded hybrid degradable membranes were also characterized. The experimental results suggest that 3D-printed PCL meshes exhibited comparable strengths to commercial POP meshes and survived through 10,000 cycles of fatigue test without breakage. Hybrid PCL meshes/PLGA nanofibrous membranes provided a sustainable release of metronidazole, lidocaine, and estradiol for 4, 25, and 30 days, respectively, in vitro. The membranes further liberated high levels of CTGF for more than 30 days. The animal tests show that the mechanical property of PCL mesh decreased with time, mainly due to degradation of the polymers post-implantation. No adverse effect of the mesh/nanofibers was noted in the histological images. By adopting solution-extrusion 3D printing and coaxial electrospinning, degradable drug-eluting membranes can be fabricated for POP applications.',\n",

The laser cladding process is associated with nonuniform material strength within the clad and the heat-affected-zone. In addition, residual stress development increases the crack driving forces and reduces the fatigue life of the part. In the present work, a 3D transient fully coupled thermal metallurgical-mechanical numerical model was built to simulate the coaxial powder injection laser cladding process for P420 stainless steel powder on an AISI 1018 steel plate for 50% +/- 10% bead overlap conditions. This work is an extension of prior physical and virtual simulation analyses. The model was employed to explore the effect of depositing directions and overlapping configurations on the temperature field evolution, thermal cycling characteristics, mechanical properties, and induced distortions in the clad and substrate. The model was validated by Vickers microhardness measurements and heat affected-zone geometry from the specimens' cross-sectioning. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental measurements with a 14% maximum error. It was found that the 50% bead overlap configuration with a raster fill deposition pattern had the most consistent hardness results, and minimal distortion. The presented simulation methodology can be used to predict the mechanical and physical properties of laser cladded components and to provide relevant information for process planning decisions.\",\n",

Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)-Ti6Al4V interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) with comprehensive mechanical properties were developed using a two-step process: fabricating Ti6Al4V microlattices using powder bed fusion (PBF) and subsequently manufacturing PEEK-Ti6Al4V IPCs using vacuum infiltration. The strut defects in the Ti6Al4V microlattices induced by PBF process were filled with PEEK, and thus excellent interfacial connection was achieved. Mechanical tests, under both quasi-static loading conditions (compression and three-point bending conditions) and dynamic loading condition (three-point bending condition), were carried out on the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites with low and high modulus (20.0 and 60.0 vol% Ti6Al4V) and the bare Ti6Al4V microlattices of equivalent elastic moduli. It was found that the composites had higher compressive and flexural strengths than the lattices. Moreover, the composites exhibited higher fatigue strength and longer fatigue life than the lattices. The fracture behaviors and the FEM simulation results revealed that the enhancing mechanisms for the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites can be the alleviation of strut deformation and the resistance to crack propagation. Thus, the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites can be promising materials for large and load-bearing implants. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is particularly appealing to Inconel 718 because of its near-net-shape production capability for circumventing the poor machinability of this superalloy. Nevertheless, AM parts are prone to porosity, which is detrimental to their fatigue resistance. Thus, further understanding of their fatigue behavior is required before their widespread use in load-bearing applications. In this work, the microstructure and fatigue properties of AM Inconel 718, produced in a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS TM) system and heat treated with a standard heat treatment schedule, are evaluated at room temperature. Fully reversed strain controlled fatigue tests were performed on cylindrical specimens with straight gage sections at strain amplitudes ranging from 0.001 mm/mm to 0.01 mm/mm. The fracture surfaces of fatigue specimens were inspected with a scanning electron microscope. The results indicate that the employed heat treatment allowed the large, elongated grains and dendritic structure of the as-built material to break down into smaller, equiaxed grains, with some dendritic structures remaining between layers. The AM specimens were found to possess lower fatigue resistance than wrought Inconel 718, and this is primarily attributed to the presence of brittle metal-carbide/oxide inclusions or pores near their surface.',\n",

The smooth specimens were manufactured in two different orientations to study the influence of anisotropy, and the specimens were machined to final dimensions with conventional techniques.

A new distortion calibration technique for bi-prism-based single-lens 3D digital image correlation (BSL3DDIC) is proposed to in-situ and online characterize 3D full-field deformation with high precision. Virtual displacement extensometers (VDEs) are arranged from the displacement field for the crack opening displacement (COD) determination. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of VDEs locations on the precision of COD measurement is first theoretically analyzed, and the arrangement of VDEs has been optimized. Noticeably, similar quantitative analyses are conducted to determine crack opening ratio (COR) for crack closure evaluation. Moreover, via fitting full-field displacement data to a theoretical model for anisotropic material, not only mode-I effective stress intensity factor (SIF) expressed as KIeff and mode-II effective SIF (K pi eff), but also theoretical SIF (KItheo), crack opening SIF (KIopen) and crack opening load ratio (COLR) are obtained.

This study aims to investigate the effect of gradient on fatigue behaviors of lattice structures under the cyclic loading lateral to the gradient direction. The Gyroid-type triply periodic minimal surface was utilized to design GLS with continuously varied volume fraction (VF) from 10% to 40%. Uniaxial compressive testing and compressioncompression fatigue testing were conducted on the Ti-6Al-4V Gyroid lattice structures with both uniform and graded VFs fabricated by laser powder bed fusion. Three typical fracture modes and mixed fracture modes were all observed on the fracture surfaces of struts after fatigue testing. The fatigue life of Gyroid GLSs is 1.21-1.67 times that of uniform counterparts with an identical overall VF. The enhancement mechanism on fatigue properties coming from the gradient design is elaborated through the finite element analysis and experimental characterization. The lower level of tensile stress, bigger macro-area and micro-plastic zone on struts of the main loading-bearing constituent of Gyroid GLS relieve the stress concentration around the crack tip, thus, lower the crack propagation rate and provide stronger fatigue crack resistance. Furthermore, the struts in the main loadingbearing constituent are more prone to stretching, therefore, provide long-term carrying capacity even after the occurrence of penetrating cracks. Experiment results show that the carrying capacity can be still provided by these struts even with penetrating cracks.',\n",

The model is incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model for analysis of a full-scale offshore wind turbine founded on a tripod structure using realistic structural properties. Applicability of the 3D finite element model is validated using full-scale load test data. Four different scour conditions under two wave situations are examined for the ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and fatigue limit state (FLS). The results show that scour has a minor effect on the natural frequency of the tripod-supported wind turbine but can significantly increase the maximum cross-sectional von Mises stress of piles under the ULS and increase the deflection of piles within nearly 20 m below the original seabed under the SLS. As for the fatigue life of the tripod structure, it can also be reduced by the effect of scour. These findings provide insights which are useful for development of safe and economic design of offshore wind turbines supported by tripod foundations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The conventional composite manufacturing processes such as wet lay-up, resin transfer molding, automatic lay ups etc. suffer from a lot of practical and material issues which have limited their use. The mechanical properties of the parts produced by such processes also suffer from variation that causes problems downstream. Composites based additive manufacturing processes such as Fused Deposition Modeling and Composite Filament Fabrication are trying to remove some of the barriers to the use of composites. Additive manufacturing processes offer more design and material freedom than conventional composite manufacturing processes.

Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, and fatigue life are compared for the different processes.

One of the reasons for this might be scepticism of engineers due to the lack of knowledge regarding the expected lifetime and reliability of these components under stress. Therefore, it is necessary to find fast, easy and reliable ways to determine the expected lifetime of a component without the need to apply expensive full-scale component testing for every new part. To realise this, finite element analysis combined with fracture mechanical lifetime calculations can be applied. In this paper, crack growth kinetics of the commonly used material poly(lactic acid) have been utilised to estimate the lifetime of a component under complex loading conditions, namely fatigue and friction. The calculated lifetime, based on a damage tolerant fracture mechanics approach, was found to be in good agreement to the results of full-scale component tests, proving the applicability of the chosen approach. Applying this knowledge can vastly decrease the necessary time during component design and encourage the additive manufacturing community towards applying their components also in structurally loaded applications.',\n",

However the rubberised bitumen presents the limitation of requiring higher manufacturing and compaction temperatures. This could be solved by subjecting the tyre rubber to sort of pre-treatments such as: Adding warm-mix additives and/or using partial devulcanisation. These solutions have the potential of lowering the overall environmental impact of the asphalt pavement, however it is still not clear whether these can be detrimental for the rubberized asphalt binder mechanical properties.

An innovative combined fatigue and healing analysis will be presented and used to compare the several rubberised binders with a neat bitumen. The analysis consists in conducting time sweep tests by means of dynamic shear rheometer, by applying repeated cycles of stress or strain loading at selected temperatures and loading frequency. The healing potential of binders was evaluated by introducing short rest periods after a certain number of load pulses. At last, the unique energy parameter obtained using the Ratio of Dissipated Energy Change approach, was applied to obtain a unique index that could provide combined information for both fatigue binder damage and healing phenomenon. The results showed that the analysed rubberised bitumens show having better fatigue and healing performance when compared to the straight-run bitumen.',\n",

These include anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory drugs, secretagogues, lubricant, hormones, and autologous serum. Their potential mechanism of action and data from recent trials on efficacy/safety will be reviewed.

The stiffness-fitting fatigue cycle method is used to obtain the cycle times of the specimen in each stage of the fatigue cycle. It is found that the fatigue source nucleation stage is the main reason for the difference in fatigue life of the specimen. The surface of directly formed specimens is seriously viscous and forms several fatigue sources, resulting in very short fatigue life. Polishing treatment can reduce the surface roughness, and the annealing treatment can improve the microstructure and enhance the specimen fatigue performance. After polishing treatment, however, internal defects arc exposed on the surface. The cycle of defect nucleation fatigue source of different types and different sizes has a large difference, leading to a greater discreteness of fatigue performance.',\n",

The results of our literature review clearly show that, due to the synergism between printing parameters and the properties of the printed material, it is challenging to determine the best combination of variables for fatigue resistance. There is therefore a need for more experimental and computational fatigue studies to understand how the above-mentioned material and printing parameters affect the fatigue behavior.',\n",

However, high residual stresses are inherent to the building process and can pose a number of problems; including part distortion, cracking and a reduction in the components' mechanical strength and fatigue life. Exact stress distributions through the part volume are often not known as the methods commonly used to measure residual stresses are surface or near surface stresses. As such, the influence of build parameters, residual stresses on resultant SLM-produced part integrity is not understood. Neutron diffraction allows for the measurement of residual stress through the volume of a part using measured lattice strains, thereby providing a tool to gain insight into the SLM process and the formation of residual stresses. In this work, neutron diffraction was used to determine the distribution of residual stress in a set of rectangular SLM-produced Ti-6Al-4V samples. Results show that an increase in layer thickness reduces the stress gradients in the part. There is also evidence that changing the exposure strategy can prevent stresses from developing along a preferential axis, making a more homogeneous stress field.\",\n",

Depth dose-rates in a 3D-printed mouse phantom were also calculated to infer the compatibility of the 10 MV dose distributions for FLASH-RT in small-animal models. Coupled thermo-mechanical FEA simulations in ANSYS were subsequently used to inform the stress-strain conditions and fatigue life of the target assembly. Main results. Dose-rates of up to 128 Gy s(-1) at the phantom surface, or 85 Gy s(-1) at 1 cm depth, were obtained for a 1 x 1 cm(2) field size, 1 mm thick Ta target and 7.5 cm source-to-surface distance using the FLASH-mode beam (Ee- = 10 MeV, 2 sigma = 5 mm, P = 1 kW); furthermore, removal of the collimation assembly and using a shorter (3.5 cm) SSD afforded doserates >600 Gy s(-1), albeit at the expense of field conformality. Target temperatures were maintained below the tantalum, aluminum and cooling-water thresholds of 2000 degrees C, 300 degrees C and 100 degrees C, respectively, while the aluminum strain behavior remained everywhere elastic and helped ensure the converter survives its prescribed 5 yr operational lifetime. Significance. Effective design iteration, target cooling and failure mitigation have culminated in a robust target compatible with intensive transient (FLASH) and steady-state (diagnostic) applications. The ARIEL UHDR photon source will facilitate FLASH-RT experiments concerned with sub-second, pulsed or continuous beam irradiations at dose rates in excess of 40 Gy s(-1).',\n",

In order to improve these properties, a novel mechanical surface treatment that introduces compressive residual stress while simultaneously reducing the surface roughness is proposed. The proposed treatment uses cavitation peening combined with an abrasive slurry. The impact of the kinetic energy-charged abrasive particles, induced by collapsing water cavitation vapor bubbles, produces compressive residual stress, while the abrasive reduces the surface roughness. Plane-bending fatigue tests were carried out to determine the effectiveness of this treatment on the fatigue life and strength of titanium alloy Ti6Al4V manufactured by electron beam melting. It was demonstrated that the fatigue strength of an as-built specimen was improved from 169 MPa to 280 MPa by the proposed treatment.',\n",

The framework combines aerodynamic and mechanical models to support an automated design process. The former combines the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) AERODYN software with a genetic algorithm solver. It defines the theoretical twist angle distribution (TAD) as a function of wind speed. The procedure is repeated for a series of points that form a discrete range of wind speeds. This step establishes the full range of blade transformations. The associated theoretical TAD geometry is subsequently passed to the mechanical model. It creates the TAD geometry in the context of a novel wind turbine blade concept. The blade sections are assumed to be made by additive manufacturing, which enables tunable stiffness. An optimization problem minimizes the difference between the practical and theoretical TAD over the full range of transformations. It does so by selecting the actuator locations and the torsional stiffness ratios of consecutive segments. In the final step, the blade free shape (undeformed position) is found. The model and design support out-of-plane twisting, which can increase energy production and mitigate fatigue loads. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study based on energy production. It employs data acquired from the NREL Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment. A set of blade transformations required to improve the efficiency of a fixed-speed system is examined. The results show up to 3.7% and 2.9% increases in the efficiency at cut-in and rated speeds, respectively.',\n",

In the presented work, the influence of chemical composition of the used powder on the fatigue behavior of Selectively Laser Melted (SLM) and Laser Deposition Welded (LDW) specimens made of austenitic stainless steel AISI 316L was investigated. Therefore, in each manufacturing process two variations of chemical composition of the used powder were utilized. For qualitative characterization of the materials cyclic deformation behavior, load increase tests (LITs) were performed and further used for the physically based lifetime calculation method (PhyBaL(LIT)), enabling an efficient determination of stress (S)-number of cycles to failure (N-f) curves (S-N-f), which show excellent correlation to additionally performed constant amplitude tests (CATs). Moreover, instrumented cyclic indentation tests (PhyBaL(CHT)) were utilized to characterize the materials' defect tolerance in a comparably short time. All material variants exhibit a high influence of microstructural defects on the fatigue properties. Consequently, for the SLM process a higher fatigue lifetime at lower stress amplitudes could be observed for the batch with a higher defect tolerance, resulting from a more pronounced deformation induced austenite-proportional to'-martensite transformation. In correspondence to that, the batch of LDW material with an increased defect tolerance exhibit a higher fatigue strength. However, the differences in defect tolerance between the LDW batches is only slightly influenced by phase transformation and seems to be mainly governed by differences in hardening potential of the austenitic microstructure. Furthermore, a significantly higher fatigue strength could be observed for SLM material in relation to LDW specimens, because of a refined microstructure and smaller microstructural defects of SLM specimens.\",\n",

Criminals tamper the surveillance camera settings so that their (criminal) activities in the scene are not recorded properly, thereby making the captured video frames useless. Various camera tampering/sabotage include - changing the normal view of the camera by turning the camera away from the scene, obstructing the camera lens by placing some objects in front of the camera or spraying paint on it and defocusing the camera lens by changing the camera focus settings, spraying water or some viscous fluid on it. Manual monitoring of the surveillance systems have many limitations - human fatigue, lack of continuous monitoring, etc. Hence, real-time automated analysis and detection of suspicious events have gained importance.

Changes in the defect morphology were monitored via interrupted fatigue testing with periodic X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning. Prior to specimen failure, the near surface pores grew by approximately a factor of 2 and tortuous fatigue cracks were initiated and propagated towards the nearest free surface. Elastic-plastic finite element analysis showed cyclic plastic deformation at the pore root as a result of stress concentration; consequently for an applied tension-tension cyclic stress (stress ratio 0.1), the local stress at the pore root became a tension-compression nature (local stress ratio -1.0).

To overcome these limitations, functionally gradient ceramic/metallic coatings have been produced by high-energy beams for high-temperature applications in the aerospace and turbine industries to increase the life of turbine components. Thermal spray processes have long been used to apply high-temperature thermal barrier coatings to improve the life of turbine components. However, these processes have not met the increased demand by the aerospace and turbine industries to obtain higher engine temperatures and increased life enhancement as a result of the inhomogeneous microstructure, unmelted particles, voids, and poor bonding with the substrate. High-energy beams, i.e. electron beam-physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD), laser glazing, laser surface alloying, and laser surface cladding, have been explored to enhance the life of turbine components and overcome the limitations of the thermal spray processes. EB-PVD has overcome some of the disadvantages of the thermal spray processes a nd has increased the life of turbine components by a factor of two as a result of the columnar microstructure in the thermal barrier coating (TBC). Laser glazing has been used to produce metastable phases, amorphous material, and a fine-grained microstructure, resulting in improved surface properties such as fatigue, wear, a nd corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures without changing the composition of the surface material. Laser surface alloying and laser surface cladding have shown promising results in improving the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the substrate's surface.

In order to obtain qualified mechanical properties, SLM parameters and post processing should be tailored for diverse service conditions. Fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior are critical characteristics for damage tolerance evaluation of such metallic structures, and they are affected by post processing technologies significantly. The objective of this study is to obtain the fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth behavior of Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by SLM, and to evaluate the influence of post-SLM thermomechanical treatment and surface machining. Fracture toughness and FCG tests were performed for SLM Ti-6Al-4V in three types of post processing status: as-built, heat treated and hot isostatically pressed (HIPed), respectively. Specimens with as-built and machined surface were tested. The microstructure and fractography were analyzed as well in order to investigate the relevance among manufacture process, microstructure and mechanical properties. The results demonstrate that as-built SLM Ti-6Al-4V presents poor ductility and FCG behavior due to martensitic microstructure and residual stresses. Both heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing improve the plane-stress fracture toughness and FCG performance considerably, while surface machining shows slight effect.

The SLM materials possessed a columnar microstructure extending along the building direction. This microstructure was mainly composed of the acicular alpha' martensite phase. Due to the generation of the fine alpha' phase, the static strength of the SLM materials was markedly higher than that of the wrought material although their elongation was lower. There was anisotropy in the static strength and the ductility of the SLM materials. In spite of the higher tensile strength, the fatigue strength of the SLM materials was much lower than that of the wrought material since molding defects may induce stress concentration and accelerate the generation of fatigue cracks.\",\n",

The consequence is that most observers watching 3D displays have complained about visual fatigue. The measurement of the accommodation response is therefore necessary to develop human-friendly 3D displays. However, only few studies about accommodation measurement have been reported. Most of the investigations have been focused on the measurement and analysis of monocular accommodation responses only because the accommodation response works individually in each eye. Moreover, a main eye perceives dominantly the object distance. However, the binocular accommodation response should be examined because both eyes are used to watch the 3D display in natural conditions. The ophthalmic instrument that we developed enabled to measure changes in the accommodation response of the two eyes simultaneously. Two cameras acquired separately the infrared images reflected from each eyes after the reflected beams passed through a cylindrical lens. The changes in the accommodation response could then be estimated from the changes in the astigmatism ratio of the infrared images that were acquired in real time. In this paper, we compared the accommodation responses of main eye between the monocular and the binocular conditions. The two eyes were measured one by one, with only one eye opened, during measurement for monocular condition. Then the two eyes were examined simultaneously for binocular condition.

The trade-off for this advantage is that AM parts are extremely vulnerable to residual stresses (RSs), which may lead to geometrical distortions and quality inspection failures. Additionally, tensile RSs negatively impact the fatigue life and other mechanical performance characteristics of the parts in service. Therefore, in order for AM to cross the borders of prototyping toward a viable manufacturing process, the major challenge of RS development must be addressed. Different AM technologies contain many unique features and parameters, which influence the temperature gradients in the part and lead to development of RSs. The stresses formed in AM parts are typically observed to be compressive in the center of the part and tensile on the top layers. To mitigate these stresses, process parameters must be optimized, which requires exhaustive and costly experimentations. Alternative to experiments, holistic computational frameworks which can capture much of the physics while balancing computational costs are introduced for rapid and inexpensive investigation into development and prevention of RSs in AM.

As a model system, CrN coatings with a thickness of 3 mu m deposited on steel, hard metal and Si(I 00) substrates using reactive magnetron sputtering at a temperature of 350 degrees C are used. The coatings are at first characterized by means of in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a commercially available temperature attachment and by applying heating and cooling rates of less than 0.3 degrees C/s. The treatment results in the expected reduction of intrinsic stresses which are independent of substrate material but strongly influenced by substrate roughness. To simulate local thermal fatigue, selected coating/substrate composites are thermally cycled using a laser beam of 6 mm in diameter in a temperature range of 50-850 degrees C applying up to 10(4) cycles and using heating and cooling rates of about 10(3) degrees C/s. Subsequently, laser cycled samples are analyzed using synchrotron XRD, scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam technique. Laser pulses cause a reduction of compressive stresses in the coatings and a development of tensile stresses in the substrates accompanied by formation of cracks and ripples. The results show that the changes of the local macro- and micro-strains/stresses in the coatings and in the underlying substrates are strongly interlinked. The stress relaxation in the coatings is caused by recovery effects, by micro-cracks formed in the tensely-stressed coating and by plastic deformation of the metallic substrates.

Moreover, fatigue loading is a critical scenario for such components and needs to be investigated thoroughly. Consequently, the current study aims at establishing sound microstructure-defect-property relationships under cyclic loading for a TiAl6V4 alloy processed by selective laser melting. Employing mechanical testing, hot isostatic pressing, electron microscopy and computer tomography it is shown that the micron sized pores mainly affect fatigue strength, while residual stresses have a strong impact on fatigue crack growth.

       " ['The second-generation aluminum-magnesium-scandium (Al-Mg-Sc) alloy, which is often referred to as Scalmalloy (R), has been developed as a high-strength aluminum alloy for selective laser melting (SLM). The high-cooling rates of melt pools during SLM establishes the thermodynamic conditions for a fine-grained crack-free aluminum structure saturated with fine precipitates of the ceramic phase Al-3-Sc. The precipitation allows tensile and fatigue strength of Scalmalloy (R) to exceed those of AlSi10Mg by similar to 70%. Knowledge about properties of other additive manufacturing processes with slower cooling rates is currently not available. In this study, two batches of Scalmalloy (R) processed by SLM and laser metal deposition (LMD) are compared regarding microstructure-induced properties. Microstructural strengthening mechanisms behind enhanced strength and ductility are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fatigue damage mechanisms in low-cycle (LCF) to high-cycle fatigue (HCF) are a subject of study in a combined strategy of experimental and statistical modeling for calculation of Woehler curves in the respective regimes. Modeling efforts are supported by non-destructive defect characterization in an X-ray computed tomography (mu-CT) platform. The investigations show that Scalmalloy (R) specimens produced by LMD are prone to extensive porosity, contrary to SLM specimens, which is translated to similar to 30% lower fatigue strength.',\n",

       " ['Additive manufacturing of industrially-relevant high-performance parts and products is today a reality, especially for metal additive manufacturing technologies. The design complexity that is now possible makes it particularly useful to improve product performance in a variety of applications. Metal additive manufacturing is especially well matured and is being used for production of end-use mission-critical parts. The next level of this development includes the use of intentionally designed porous metals -architected cellular or lattice structures. Cellular structures can be designed or tailored for specific mechanical or other performance characteristics and have numerous advantages due to their large surface area, low mass, regular repeated structure and open interconnected pore spaces. This is considered particularly useful for medical implants and for lightweight automotive and aerospace components, which are the main industry drivers at present. Architected cellular structures behave similar to open cell foams, which have found many other industrial applications to date, such as sandwich panels for impact absorption, radiators for thermal management, filters or catalyst materials, sound insulation, amongst others. The advantage of additively manufactured cellular structures is the precise control of the micro-architecture which becomes possible. The huge potential of these porous architected cellular materials manufactured by additive manufacturing is currently limited by concerns over their structural integrity. This is a valid concern, when considering the complexity of the manufacturing process, and the only recent maturation of metal additive manufacturing technologies. Many potential manufacturing errors can occur, which have so far resulted in a widely disparate set of results in the literature for these types of structures, with especially poor fatigue properties often found. These have improved over the years, matching the maturation and improvement of the metal additive manufacturing processes. As the causes of errors and effects of these on mechanical properties are now better understood, many of the underlying issues can be removed or mitigated. This makes additively manufactured cellular structures a highly valid option for disruptive new and improved industrial products. This review paper discusses the progress to date in the improvement of the fatigue performance of cellular structures manufactured by additive manufacturing, especially metal-based, providing insights and a glimpse to the future for fatigue-tolerant additively manufactured architected cellular materials.',\n",

       " ['To use Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology for production of safety critical structural components, it is indispensable to investigate thoroughly the materials AM specific microstructure as well as the resulting mechanical and especially cyclic properties. Besides their special microstructure, AM materials show a highly inhomogeneous distribution of residual stresses as well as numerous process induced microstructural notches, e.g. pores in the materials volume and high roughness of additively manufactured surfaces. Therefore, in production of AM components stress-relief heat treatments as well as surface post-processing are commonly used. In the present work, the influence of stress-relief heat treatment as well as the additively manufactured surface condition on the cyclic properties was investigated at selectively laser melted (SLM) specimens made of AISI 316L stainless steel. Specimens were manufactured in horizontal as well as vertical building direction, leading to layer planes oriented parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction, respectively. To reduce the high material and time effort in fatigue investigations, the short-time methods PhyBaL(CHT), which is based on cyclic indentation tests and enables a characterization of the materials defect tolerance, as well as load increase tests (LITs) were used for qualitative analyzes of the cyclic deformation behavior. Moreover, the physically based lifetime calculation approach (PhyBaL(LIT)) was applied for quantitative determination of the fatigue behavior of heat treated specimens, showing excellent correlation to additional constant amplitude tests (CATs), performed for validation. While the heat treatment does not significantly influence the fatigue behavior of vertically built specimens, an increase of fatigue strength could be observed for horizontal building direction, which is mainly caused by an improved defect tolerance. The higher defect tolerance was determined with PhyBaL(CHT) and could be proved by fracture mechanics considerations using the root area-concept. Furthermore, the results show a significantly lower fatigue lifetime for additively manufactured surface condition compared with polished samples, which is more pronounced for vertically built specimens, because of the higher surface roughness of specimens manufactured in this building direction. Moreover, a double-staged S-N t curve could be observed for specimens with additively manufactured surface, which correlates to the cyclic deformation behavior observed in LITs and CATs.',\n",

       " [\"Objective The 24CrNiMo alloy steel has good strength and toughness matching, as well as thermal stability, making it a suitable material for manufacturing high-speed train brake discs. Traditional alloy steel brake disc manufacturing techniques have a complex manufacturing procedure and a long processing cycle, which cannot meet the increasingly complex design requirements. Selective laser melting allows for the free design and production of parts with complex structures, high forming precision and good surface quality, significantly shortening the product development and production cycle. The fabrication of the 24CrNiMo alloy steel using advanced selective laser melting technology has some research value. The process parameters of the selective laser melting technology are critical to the brake disc's performance. Scanning strategy is an important process parameter for selective laser melting (SLM) brake disc manufacturing. This study aims to analyse the effect of scanning strategy on the microstructure and thermal fatigue performance of SLM formed parts of 24CrNiMo alloy steel. During long-term service, high-temperature thermal fatigue will crack the brake disc. When the crack reaches a certain length, the brake disc will fail. It is necessary to investigate and evaluate the high-temperature performance of SLM formed parts made of 24CrNiMo alloy steel before they can be used in actual production. Methods To analyse the microstructure and properties of SLM parts under different scanning strategies, EP-M250 selective laser melting equipment was used to fabricate 24CrNiMo alloy steel samples under four scanning strategies: 0 degrees linear scanning, 45 degrees rotating scanning, 90 degrees rotating scanning, and 67 degrees rotating scanning. The Archimedes drainage method was used to determine the density of samples under various scanning strategies. The optical microscope and scanning electron microscope were used to analyse the microstructure of the formed parts. For phase analysis of the formed parts using different scanning strategies, an X-ray diffractometer was used. The scanning strategy's effect on the microstructure of formed parts was investigated. A thermal fatigue test device was used to evaluate the thermal fatigue performance of the formed parts with different scanning strategies on a flat specimen with a V-shaped notch. Results and Discussions The grain orientation distribution reflects the effect of the laser scanning strategy on the microstructure of SLM samples. The grain growth under the 0 degrees linear scanning strategy has a strong orientation when compared to the rotating scanning strategy. The grains growing along each orientation intersect at the centre of the molten pool during solidification, and the microstructure boundary is formed at the centre of the molten pool [Fig. 7 (a) and (c)]. The rotation scanning strategy shifts the direction of heat dissipation between adjacent layers, disrupting grain epitaxial growth. The grain orientations are random, and the texture is poor [Fig. 7 (b) and (c)]. When the 0 degrees linear scanning path is parallel to the direction of the thermal fatigue notch, the molten pool' s centre has high microstructure heterogeneity and becomes a weak area, and the thermal fatigue specimen has a high crack growth rate. Under rotating scanning strategy, the grain orientation is random, and the formed part had no obvious microstructure boundary and molten pool weak zone, which hinders thermal fatigue crack growth. Under different cycles, the rotating scanning strategy sample has a lower thermal fatigue crack growth rate than the 0 degrees linear scanning sample (Fig. 10). Conclusions In this study, the 24CrNiMo alloy steel was fabricated by SLM technology. The effects of scanning strategy on microstructure, phase composition and thermal fatigue properties of the formed parts were studied. The change of scanning strategy changes the morphology of the molten pool. Under different scanning strategies, the microstructure of SLM formed part of 24CrNiMo alloy steel consists of granular bainite, martensite, and residual austenite. The phase compositions of the formed parts using various scanning strategies are alpha-Fe with a trace of gamma-Fe. The grains have a strong orientation when using the 0 degrees linear scanning strategy. The rotation scanning strategy has a crushing effect on the crystal grain's prolonged growth, and the orientation is weakened. When the laser scanning path is parallel to the notch direction of the thermal fatigue samples, the crack length increases fastest and finally reaches 1162 ttm. The molten pool's centre has a high degree of microstructure heterogeneity, making it easy for the thermal fatigue crack to spread. Crack propagation is hampered by the random distribution of grain orientation in rotating scanning mode. Thermal fatigue crack propagation is caused by the combined action of thermal stress and high-temperature oxidation.\",\n",

This process creates brittle components as a powder is set with a weak binder material; however, the component strength characteristics can be significantly modified when infiltrating the component during post processing operations. The different factors that can influence the mechanical properties when engaging in post processing operations need to be understood. A full factorial design of experiments (DOE) is conducted for tensile, compressive, and flexural specimens for 10 infiltrate and various build conditions. The experiment and resultants are set up to perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA). All of the observed stress-strain curves for the specimens are non-linear, or have limited linear regions. The infiltrate absorption depth affects the mechanical characteristics, and the binder jetting specimens are stronger in compression than tension. The tensile test results are similar to those of biological materials. Certain infiltrates do not improve the mechanical performance characteristics, which are validated using the Tukey method. This research needs to be extended in scope to include additional build orientations as well as torsion, fatigue, and notch tests to be able to predict model sensitivities effectively for components built using the binder jetting process, and to develop optimization strategies, which include time, material, and strength conditions.\",\n",

       " [\"Residual stress builds up during the fabrication of components via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process which causes parts to fail due to the crack initiation and growth, low fatigue life, and fall outside of the specified dimensions. During the thermal loading, the grain size affected by strain hardening and flow softening is altered at the subsurface through dynamic recrystallization (DRx) and subsequent recovery. The yield strength of the alloys is largely determined by the size of nucleated grains, and it has a substantial influence on flow stress and residual stress build-up. In this work, a physics-based analytical model is proposed to predict the residual stress affected by the strain hardening, flow softening, and microstructural evolution during L-PBF process with IN718 as a material system for exploration. The temperature field is predicted using a transient moving point heat source approach. Due to the non-uniform heating, materials experience high thermal stress which may exceed the yield strength of the material. The thermal stress is obtained from Green's functions of stresses due to the point body load. A material constitutive flow stress model known as Johnson-Cook is used to determine the yield surface. This flow stress model is modified to incorporate the effects of flow softening and grain size. The dynamic recrystallization and grain refinement models are used to calculate the grain size using recrystallized volume fraction from nucleation and growth rates. As a result of the cyclic heating and cooling and the fact that the material is yielded, the residual stress build-up is precited using incremental plasticity and kinematic hardening behavior of the metal according to the property of volume invariance in plastic deformation in coupling with the equilibrium and compatibility conditions. Results from the analytical residual stress model showed good agreement with X-ray diffraction measurements used to determine the residual stresses in the IN718 specimens built via L-PBF.\",\n",

It is particularly aiming at exploring waste lipstick (WLS) as a high-quality functional additive for advanced asphalt mix technologies. To fuel this novel innovation, the effect of various WLS doses (e.g., 5, 10, and 15 wt.%) on the performance of base AP-5 asphalt cement was studied in detail. A wide array of cutting-edge analytical lab techniques was employed to inspect in-depth the physicochemical, microstructural, thermo-morphological, and rheological properties of resultant admixtures including: elemental analysis, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thin-layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), needle penetration, ring and ball softening point, Brookfield viscometer, ductility, and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests. Unlike the unstable response of asphaltenes, the additive/artificial aging treatments increased the fraction of resins the most, and decreased that of aromatics; however, asphaltenes did not impair the saturates portion, according to Iatroscan research. FT-IR scan divulged that the WLS-asphalt interaction was physical rather than chemical. XRD diagnosis not only revealed an obvious correlation between the asphaltenes content and the fresh-binder crystallinity but also revealed the presence of fillers in the WLS, which may generate outstanding technical qualities to bituminous mixes. According to AFM/SEM analyses, the stepwise incorporation of WLS grew the magnitude of the bee-shaped microstructures and extended the roughness rate of unaged/aged binders. The prolonged consumption of the high thermal-stable additive caused a remarkable drop in the onset degradation and glass transition temperature of mixtures, thus enhancing their workability and low-temperature performance, according to TGA/DTGA/DSC data. The DSR and empirical rheological experiments demonstrated that the WLS could effectively lower the manufacturing and compaction temperatures of asphalt mixes and impart them with valuable anti-aging/fatigue-cracking assets. In a nutshell, the use of waste lipstick as an asphalt modifier is viable and cost-effective and could attenuate the pollution arisen from the beauty sector, while improving the performance of hot/warm asphalt mixes (HAM/WAM) and extending the service life of roadways.',\n",

This leaves space enough for the setup of the specimens and the loading equipment. The application of LDM in the fracture mechanics testing makes it possible to observe and measure continuously when the specimen is being loaded.

In this study, the electronic package is a CSP mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) using an area array of solder joints varying from 5x4 up to 7x7. An empirical model for estimating the reliability of CSP solder joints is derived by correlating the simulated strains to thermal cycling results for 20 different sample configurations. This empirical model translates the inelastic strains calculated by nonlinear three-dimensional (3D) finite element simulations into a reliability estimation (N-50% or N-100 ppm). By comparing with the results of reliability tests, it can be concluded that this model is accurate and consistent for analyzing the effect of solder joint geometry. Afterwards, parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted by integrating a design of experiment (DOE) analysis with the reliable solder fatigue prediction models, following the method of simulation-based optimization. Several parameters are analyzed: the PCB parameters (elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, thickness), the chip dimensions (area array configuration), and the parameters defining the solder joint geometry (substrate and chip pad diameter solder volume). The first study analyzes how the solder joint geometry influences the CSP reliability. A second study is a tolerance analysis for six parameters. These parameters can have a tolerance (=accuracy) of their nominal value, and it is shown that these small tolerances can have a significant influence on the solder joint reliability.',\n",

Strain gauge measurements can constitute an important toot in acquiring better understanding of the complex stress field in the deck plate.

The durability and reliability of microlattice and metafoam architected materials were compared with those composed of various foamed materials currently used in medical insoles. The hardness of the architected materials was able to be continuously adjusted by controlling the design parameters, and the combination of the two materials was effective in controlling rebound resilience. In particular, the features of the architected materials were helpful for customizing the insole properties, such as hardness, propulsive force, and shock absorption, according to the user's needs. Further, using elastomer as a component led to better results in fatigue testing and UV resistance compared with the plastic foam currently used for medical purposes. Specifically, polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate were deformed in the fatigue test, and polyurethane was mechanically deteriorated by UV rays.

We undertook this study to assess the prevalence of surgeons' deleterious perceptions or injuries related to laparoscopic urologic surgery. METHODS Members of endourological society were mailed a questionnaire evaluating their laparoscopic experience, total number of standard laparoscopic surgeries (SLS), hand-assisted laparoscopic surgeries (HALS), and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries (RALS) they performed. The subjects reported any neuromuscular or arthritic injuries sustained during laparoscopic surgery, and graded the degree of pain, numbness, and fatigue they experienced. RESULTS A total of 73 urologists completed the questionnaires. The average responder was 44 years old, had completed a median of 117 procedures, and was performing 3 laparoscopic surgeries per week. Neuromuscular or arthritic symptoms during surgery were reported by 22 responders (30%), the most common was finger paresthesia (18%). At the conclusion of HALS, 45% of the surgeons suffered from hand and wrist numbness and 37% reported pain in these areas. A significant association was observed between the risk of sustaining injury during surgery and the total number of laparoscopic procedures performed by the responder (P = 0.016). RALS was the procedure least associated with injuries, and HALS the most. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic operating theater is a hostile ergonomic environment.

Keeping this in view, the effect of process parameters such as laser power (w), layer thickness (t), and scan rotation (phi) on pore size, shape and distribution in selectively laser melted (SLM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy specimens and the influence of such pore characteristics on the HCF life under rotating bending fatigue conditions were investigated in this work. X-ray tomography was used to characterize the porosity in coupons produced using four different w-t-phi combinations. The possibility of enhancing the fatigue strength (sigma(f)) of the as-fabricated alloy through microstructural modification, via a post-fabrication heat-treatment that substantially improves the threshold for fatigue crack initiation, and subsequent shot peening were explored. Results show that the pore sizes and distribution are sensitive to the process parameters utilized; pores align in the build direction for phi = 90 degrees whereas they are randomly distributed for phi = 67 degrees, and a higher t results in denser parts. These observations are rationalized by recourse to the combined effect of the Marangoni convection and the Rayleigh instability in adjoining melt-pools. Only a marginal improvement in of upon heat treatment was noted, whereas shot peening enhances it substantially such that sigma(f) is up to 55% of the tensile strength.

Innovative analysis methods are proposed to correlate shape and position of pores, to determine the angular-resolved surface roughness, and to quantify the amount of re-entrant surface features, q. A meshing of the XCT surface enables the correlation of q with the classical surface roughness P (a). This analysis leads to the conclusion that there is a linear correlation between q and P (a).

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a metal based AM process with significant and growing potential for the manufacture of aerospace components. Traditionally a material needs to be listed in the Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS) handbook if it is to be considered certified. However, this requires a considerable amount of test data to be generated on the material's mechanical properties. Therefore, the MMPDS certification process does not lend itself easily to the certification of AM components as the final component can have similar mechanical properties to wrought alloys combined with the defects associated with traditional casting and welding technologies. These defects can substantially decrease the fatigue life of a fabricated component. The primary purpose of this investigation was to study the fatigue behaviour of as-built Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) samples. Fatigue tests were performed on the Ti-6Al-4V specimens built using SLM with a variety of layer thicknesses and build (vertical or horizontal) directions. Fractography revealed the presence of a range of manufacturing defects located at or near the surface of the specimens. The experimental results indicated that Lack-of-Fusion (LOF) defects were primarily responsible for fatigue crack initiation. The reduction in fatigue life appeared to be affected by the location, size and shape of the LOF defect.\",\n",

The specific roughness of as-built surfaces was evaluated by several acquisition methods(2D and 3D profilometry, tomography) on as-built surfaces and different surface finish (machining and chemical polishing). Fatigue strength of SLM and EBM specimens with an as built, machined or chemically polished surface were evaluated under fully reverse tension (R-sigma = 1) and torsion (R-tau = 1). Fractography analyses were performed in order to identify defects at the origin of fatigue crack initiation. Finally, a numerical approach based on finite element (FE) computation of real surface topologies was proposed to quantify the effect of the surface roughness on fatigue strength. The surface roughness was modelled from 2D and 3D profilometry and the FE computations were conducted in elasticity and elastoplasticity. The proposed numerical approach combines a non local fatigue indicator parameter (FIP) integrating the high stress gradients at notch root and a statistical description of potential initiation sites by extreme value statistics.',\n",

For a reliable antifouling strategy we prepared nitinol (NiTi) thin films on Ti-derived substrates by using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. As the microstructure of Ti-alloy is dictated by the tensile strength, fatigue and the fracture toughness we tested the use of hydrogen as an alloying element. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigated the crystalline structure, chemical composition and respectively the surface morphology of the nitinol hydrogen and hydrogen-free samples. Moreover, the alloys were integrated and tested using a cellular metric and their responses were systematic evaluated and quantified. Our attractive approach is meant to select the suitable components for an effective and trustworthy anti-fouling strategy. A greater understanding of such processes should lead to novel and effective control methods that would improve in the future implant stability and capabilities.

Nowadays, it is increasingly being used in the industrial manufacturing of titanium-alloy components for aerospace and medical industries; however, the main weakness of structural parts is the fatigue life, which is affected by surface quality, meaning the micro-cracking of small surface defects induced by the manufacturing process. Laser finishing and Abrasive Fluidized Bed are proposed by the authors since they represent cost-effective and environment-friendly alternatives for automated surface finishing. A comparison between these two finishing technologies was established and discussed. Experimental tests investigated both mechanical properties and fatigue performances. The tests also focused on understanding the basic mechanisms involved in fatigue failures of machined Ti-6Al-4V components fabricated via Electron Beam Melting and the effects of operational parameters. X-ray tomography was used to evaluate the internal porosity to better explain the fatigue behaviour. The results demonstrated the capability of Laser finishing and Abrasive Fluidized Beds to improve failure performances. Life Cycle Analysis was additionally performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technologies in terms of environmental impact and resource consumption.',\n",

These defects not only lead to premature failure, but also contribute to the significant dispersion of fatigue life commonly seen in metal additive manufacturing. In this work, we have studied the source of dispersion and the influence of pore size on fatigue life using samples from the standard processing route and samples with intentionally introduced porosity defects. According to the fracture surface study, contrary to the common belief, the source of dispersion is primarily the pore location, e.g. surface or embedded pore, rather than the pore size. In the case of embedded pores as the failure source, a threshold pore size of approximately 85 mu m was observed, below which the wrought level fatigue performance was achieved. For surface pores above the threshold size, fatigue life was reduced by two orders of magnitude, but remained unchanged, even though crack initiating pore size increased roughly by a factor of four. This experimental observation was supported by local elastic stress analysis, which indicated that pores above a certain size could behave like micro-notches suggesting the popular Kitagawa-Takahashi diagrams should be presented with a horizontal asymptote for this alloy.',\n",

       " ['Static structural aeroengine components are typically designed for full lifetime operation. Under this assumption, efforts to reduce weight in order to improve the performance result in structural designs that necessitate proven yet expensive manufacturing solutions to ensure high reliability. However, rapid developments in fabrication technologies such as additive manufacturing may offer viable alternatives for manufacturing and/or repair, in which case different component lifing decisions may be preferable. The research presented in this paper proposes a value-maximizing design framework that models and optimizes component lifing decisions in an aeroengine product-service system context by considering manufacturing and maintenance alternatives. To that end, a lifecycle cost model is developed as a proxy of value creation. Component lifing decisions are made to minimize net present value of lifecycle costs. The impact of manufacturing (represented by associated intial defects) and maintenance strategies (repair and/or replace) on lifing design decisions is quantified by means of failure models whose output is an input to the lifecycle cost model. It is shown that, under different conditions, it may not be prudent to design for full life but rather accept shorter life and then repair or replace the component. This is especially evident if volumetric effects on low cycle fatigue life are taken into account. It is possible that failure rates based on legacy engines do not translate necessarily to weight-optimized components. Such an analysis can play a significant supporting role in engine component design in a product-service system context.',\n",

DED affects patients' quality of life and leads eventually to decrease of productivity. Moreover, it has a considerable socioeconomic burden. It is a growing underdiagnosed health issue and the possible associated risk factors are very common and keep growing worldwide. Purpose To assess the prevalence of DED and potential associated risk factors in the Northern West Bank of Palestine. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in 16 selected towns in Northern West Bank governorates during December 2016 to September 2017. An interviewer-assisted Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to study DED symptoms in the study population. Further evaluation of clinical signs of DED was performed using the following objective tests: tear film break-up time (TBUT), fluorescein corneal staining (FL/S) and Schirmer test. Subjects with an OSDI score of 13 or above were considered symptomatic of DED, and DED was defined if an OSDI score >= 13 is accompanied by at least one of the following signs in the worse eye: TBUT <= 10 s, Schirmer score <= 5 mm and fluorescein corneal staining >= grade 1. Results Seven hundred sixty-nine subjects were recruited from the general non-clinical population in the West Bank. The mean age of participants was 43.61 +/- 18.57 years ranging from 18 to 90 years. Females constitute 52.7% of the study population. Based on the diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of DED was 64% (95% confidence interval 60.6-67.3). DED was significantly associated with female gender p = (0.001) and older age p = (0.001). Conclusion The prevalence of DED is high in the study population. Older age and female gender were associated risk factors with the development of DED.\",\n",

The effects of hot isostatic pressing(HIP) and solution treatment (ST) on the microstructure,mechanical properties,and fatigue crack growth properties of the GH3536 alloy were investigated. The results show that there are molten pool,columnar grains,dendrites, holes,and cracks in the as- deposited alloy. The HIP process can effectively heal defects,eliminate molten pools and dendrites,and make all grains grow into equiaxed grains. Besides,it can lead to the continuous precipitation of carbides along the grain boundary. After ST,many carbides dissolve back into the matrix. The tensile strength, hardness, and elongation of the as-deposited alloy are 782. 1 MPa, 227. 9 HV, and 17. 7%, respectively,and defects are essential factors affecting the plasticity. After the HIP process,the strength and hardness of the alloy decrease to 693. 7 MPa and 170. 4 HV,and its elongation increases to 34. 7%. After the ST process,the strength, hardness,and elongation of the alloy increase to 741. 0 MPa,180. 6 HV,and 48. 7%, respectively. In comparison, the fatigue crack growth resistance of the as-deposited alloy is less than that of the alloy after HIP and ST are improved.',\n",

The outstanding advantage of AM (3D-printing, direct manufacturing), is the ability to form shapes that cannot be formed with any other traditional technology. 3D-printing began as a new method of prototyping in plastics. Nowadays, AM in metals allows to realize not only net-shape geometry, but also high fatigue strength and corrosion resistant parts. This success of AM in metals enables new applications of the technology in important fields, such as production of medical implants. The 3D-printing of medical implants is an extremely rapidly developing application. The success of this development lies in the fact that patient-specific implants can promote patient recovery, as often it is the only alternative to amputation. The production of AM implants provides a relatively fast and effective solution for complex surgical cases. However, there are still numerous challenging open issues in medical 3D-printing. The goal of the current research review is to explain the whole technological and design chain of bio-medical bone implant production from the computed tomography that is performed by the surgeon, to conversion to a computer aided drawing file, to production of implants, including the necessary post-processing procedures and certification.

This study examines how in-machine 17-4 stainless steel powder feedstocks are affected by prior LPBF processes, and how these effects impact subsequent builds. Examinations of powder morphology, chemistry, flowability, and rheology were conducted to characterize the powder conditions. The resultant effects of powder feedstock condition on produced component quasi-static tensile and high-cycle fatigue properties were analyzed. Fatigue life was analyzed using a reliability modeling approach that enabled a robust statistical comparison of life. Powder characteristics were found to evolve with powder exposure to prior LPBF processes, particularly in the extremes of powder size distribution and measures of bulk flow. No significant effects of these changes on tensile properties were observed. Reliability modeling methods, including the lognormal and Weibull distributions as well as the empirical survival function, are shown to be effective tools for modeling fatigue variability in LPBF manufactured components. Through these tools, fatigue life was found to be invariant with changes in powder condition.',\n",

Findings - It is found that tensile properties, hardness and microstructure compare well to its wrought counterpart. Fatigue growth rates are also comparable, though they are influenced by residual stresses and microstructure.

In order to determine ideal production conditions for additive manufacturing method, the effect of building direction and preheating on mechanical properties was investigated. All the samples were manufactured by using same process parameters and heat treated in same conditions after production. The samples were manufactured on four different building directions (vertical, horizontal, 1x45, 2x45) and two preheating conditions (0 and 200 degrees C). After the heat treatment process completed for stress relieving, they were tested in axial tensile testing and three-point bending testing statically and dynamically. While, the orientation did not make a significant effect on mechanical properties, the strength of samples was affected negatively with preheating process. However, it was seen that the ductility and toughness of samples increased via the preheating process. The sample manufactured with preheating in vertical direction had the highest mechanical properties when compared to the other samples. Thus, the bone plates were manufactured on this condition and heat treated, then they were tested in four-point bending testing according to the ASTM F382. It was concluded that the bone plates manufactured by additive manufacturing method had better bending strength and fatigue behavior.

       " ['Contaminated surfaces of the feedstock materials in aluminum alloy casting processes often produce various types of defects which can affect the tensile properties of the final products as well as their fatigue reliabilities. Semi-solid processing takes advantage of a much higher apparent viscosity of the die cast materials by limiting the risk of oxides formed at the free surfaces to become incorporated into the casting when the material is injected into the die. Most of existing semi-solid processes that use billets as feedstock material are however tied up with a different type of contaminated surface. During the injection phase, the external-skin on the periphery of the billet, which has been in contact with air and lubricant during the transfer in the shot sleeve, can be incorporated into the casting. When subjected to a heat treatment, the lubricant is decomposed and produces lens shape porosities. This might be a cause of reject for most structural parts. To avoid this kind of defects, the paths along which the billet skin evolves must be controlled during filling. In order to investigate the possibility of skin inclusion into cast parts during injection of the billet, a two-phase finite element mixture model is employed to model the metal flow. The formation of a skin on the periphery of the billet is modeled by setting an initial solid phase concentration profile in the radial direction. Microscopic observations of the real castings show that the approach is able to model the shear layers and to predict the paths along which the lens porosity defects could be formed. An Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagangian (ALE) method is also investigated and appears to be very promising to follow the skin movement in the casting.',\n",

It is highlighted that finishing operations are able to improve significantly the fatigue resistance compared to the initial state after SLM + heat treatment. The fatigue results are also discussed in light of the surface integrity (roughness parameters and residual stresses). It is found that the surface topography skewness is an interesting parameter which correlates with the fatigue performance.

This is an important research area because porosity has a direct impact on the functional integrity of AM parts such as their fatigue life and strength. To realize this objective, an Augmented Layer-wise Spatial log Gaussian Cox process (ALS-LGCP) model is proposed. The ALS-LGCP approach quantifies the spatial distribution of pores within each layer of the AM part and tracks their sequential evolution across layers. Capturing the layer-wise spatial behavior of porosity leads to a deeper understanding of where (at what location), when (at which layer), and to what severity (size and number) pores are formed. This work therefore provides a mathematical framework for identifying specific pore-prone areas in an AM part, and tracking the evolution of porosity in AM parts in a layer-wise manner. This knowledge is essential for initiating remedial corrective actions to avoid porosity in future parts, e.g., by changing the process parameters or part design. The ALS-LGCP approach proposed herein is a significant improvement over the current scalar metric used to quantify porosity, namely, the percentage porosity relative to the bulk part volume. In this article, the ALS-LGCP approach is tested for metal parts made using a binder jetting AM process to model the layer-wise spatial behavior of porosity. Based on offline, non-destructive X-Ray computed tomography (XCT) scan data of the part the approach identifies those areas with high risk of porosity with statistical fidelity approaching 85% (F-score). While the proposed work uses offline XCT data, it takes the critical first-step from a data analytics perspective for taking advantage of the recently reported breakthroughs in online, in-situ X-Ray-based monitoring of AM processes. Further, the ALS-LGCP approach is readily extensible for porosity analysis in other AM processes; our future forays will focus on improving the computational tractability of the approach for online monitoring.',\n",

       " ['Experimental conditions for the spectrophotometric and thermal lens spectrometric (TLS) detection of catecholamines after oxidation to aminochromes with hexacyanoferrate (III) are optimized. At the low concentrations used in TLS, and in a 0.07 M citrate buffer, catecholamine oxidation can be performed at pH 7 and is immediate, whereas a lower pH value is required in spectrophotometry to avoid aminochrome polymerisation, the oxidation reactions being much slower. Similar TLS sensitivities are obtained for all catecholamines which facilitates HPLC evaluation. Sensitivity can be enhanced using a 50% ethanol-water medium. The linear dynamic range extends over two orders of magnitude, the limit of detection being about 1 ng ml-1 with a reproducibility of 2%, indicating that TLS is adequate to detect catecholamines as aminochromes in physiological samples after HPLC separation. A chromatogram of a urine sample extract is given. The catecholamines which are present in living organisms are epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and L-dopa (D). These compounds perform important neurological and hormonal functions in mammals, being found unconjugated and as conjugates. The latter exist as esters of sulphuric acid and as glucuronides, that is, as glycosidic combinations with glucuronic acid1,2. A large percentage of total catecholamines are conjugated; however, their concentration varies largely with dietary factors. Therefore, the determination of unconjugated catecholamines is preferred for diagnosis3. The concentration of unconjugated catecholamines in physiological fluids is considerably affected by physical and psychological factors, and by some diseases. Values much larger than normal can be due to the presence of some tumors such as pheochromocytoma, and to other disorders producing essential hypertension. Subjects receiving medication with phenothiazines or nitroglycerine also exhibit values higher than normal. Catecholamine concentrations are decreased by the effects of alpha-methyldopa and monoaminooxidase inhibitors3. Monitoring of catecholamine levels is also of great significance in sport medicine, in studies related to stress and fatigue situations. Speciation of catecholamines with adequate limits of detection can be performed by GC-MS4,5 or reversed-phase1,6, ion pair reversed-phase7-9 or ion-exchange10,11 HPLC using amperometric or fluorometric detection. However, amperometry on carbon electrodes lacks selectivity1,12, the almost universal response given by this detector at the high potential values used for catecholamine oxidation producing complex chromatograms with noisy backgrounds. Underivatized catecholamines show too low fluorescence quantum yields12. Strong fluorophors can be obtained using the popular trihydroxyindole method (THI), in which catecholamines are oxidized in weak acid medium and rearranged in alkaline medium12,13. However, sensitivity is about 800-fold smaller for DA than for the other catecholamines. Oxidative coupling with glycylglycine14,15 gives also a low sensitivity for DA which complicates chromatographic evaluation. In addition, the fluorescamine and o-phtaldehyde (OPA) methods cannot be used for secondary amines such as epinephrine16,17. Further, derivatisation reactions with 2-cyanoacetamide18,19, or ethylenediamine derivatives20,21, as well as with glycylglycine require 1 hour reaction times under heating conditions. Finally, dansylation lacks selectivity, all present amine groups being derivatized. Sensitivity and selectivity can be improved by using solid-phase dansylation, in which alumina retained catecholamines are derivatized; however, a 30 min reaction time is required22. In this work, the possibility of using thermal lens spectrometry (TLS), a ultrasensitive laser technique, to determine catecholamines after oxidation to aminochromes is examined. In TLS, an intense TEM00 laser beam, the pump beam, is absorbed by the sample giving rise to a temperature gradient which is associated to a gradient of refraction index. The illuminated region of the sample can be considered as an optical element. The beam of a TEM00 laser has a Gaussian profile which causes the element to have a lens shape. The optical properties of this lens (e.g. , focal length) can be probed using, for instance, a second beam, the probe beam, which undergoes a change of divergence, this change being proportional to the concentration of the absorbing substances. Substances exhibiting large molar absorptivities at the wavelength of the pump radiation can be determined by TLS at ultratrace levels. In addition, weakly absorbing substances can be also determined at much lower concentrations than in spectrophotometry23. The latter approach can be of much interest in the analysis of complex samples after HPLC separation, since many substances of clinical or biochemical interest are weak absorbents, and are found at concentrations too low to be evaluated using an UV-Vis detector. In addition, many organic substances can be easily derivatized to give weak chromophores, whereas obtaining adequate fluorophors is more difficult. Further, major sources of error associated to fluorometric procedures, including quenching and background fluorescence, are avoided using TLS detection. The practical use of TLS to detect colored substances after HPLC separation has been demonstrated24-26. In weakly acidic and neutral media, catecholamines can be oxidized to aminochromes using a variety of oxidizing agents27-30: [GRAPHICS] where R1, R2 and R3 are protons except R1 = CH3 for E, R2 = COOH for D and R3 = OH for NE and E. Aminochrome solutions are not stable, giving rise to dark precipitates which are called melanins27. Aminochromes show molar absorptivities ranging from 2500 to 3400 cm-1 mol-1 L within the 490-500 nm region. oxidation to aminochromes has been used for the spectrophotometric determination of catecholamines in pharmaceuticals31,32, the sensitivity being not high enough to analyze physiological samples. However, aminochrome absorption bands overlap with the most intense Ar+ laser lines, i.e. 488 and 514.5 nm, which should permit TLS detection of very low catecholamine concentrations. The possibility of using TLS detection after HPLC catecholamine separation at concentration levels below those required to analyze physiological samples is here demonstrated. A batch approach is used to optimize the experimental conditions for the spectrophotometric and TLS procedures, and analytical figures of merit are obtained. A preliminary result of the chromatographic work, in which the catecholamines of the urine of a normal healthy subject are detected after a non-optimized HPLC separation, is given.',\n",

The results show that the influences of the Laves phases on high-cycle fatigue properties are based on the applied stress amplitudes. At a low stress amplitude, most of the Laves phases held their original morphologies. The fatigue cracks stopped in front or detoured around them, which means that the unbroken Laves phases play an important role in hindering crack propagation. In this way, the high-cycle fatigue life of LAMed Inconel 718 was superior to that of wrought Inconel 718. However, at a high stress amplitude almost all of the Laves phases in the crack propagation region splintered into smaller fragments, parts of which separated from the austenite matrix. Microscopic holes or cracks were formed at the interface, which provided passages for the fatigue cracks to propagate. In this case, the Laves phases were harmful, leading to the degradation of fatigue performance in LAMed Inconel 718 compared with wrought Inconel 718.',\n",

We recently found the stored energy induced by SLM process and cyclic strain during fatigue testing can trigger grain boundary migration and local recrystallization behavior. In addition, the junctions between the recrystallized grain tribes and the original coarse grains can lead to the plastic strain localization, promoting the fatigue crack initiation during cyclic deformation, seriously affecting the fatigue lifetime of SLMed 304L SS. Therefore, this study carried out a series of microstructural characterizations to investigate the formation mechanisms of local recrystallization and the role of local recrystallization on the fatigue performance of SLMed 304L SS, which can advance the current understanding of fatigue failure mechanisms of additively manufactured materials. The experimental results show that the detrimental effect of local recrystallization during cyclic deformation on fatigue properties of SLMed 304L SS exceeds that of small pores.',\n",

The porosity in two additively manufactured aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) tensile samples before and after LSP was imaged using identical X-ray tomography settings and overlap of the data was performed for direct comparison. The results indicate clearly that near-surface pores are closed by the process, while internal pores remain unaffected. LSP has become well known as a method to improve the fatigue properties of materials, including those of additively manufactured aluminum alloys. This improvement is usually attributed to the compressive residual stress induced by the process. The additional effect of closure of near-surface pores that is illustrated in this work is of interest for additive manufacturing because additive manufacturing is not yet able to produce completely pore-free components. Since the critical pore initiating fatigue cracks are always attributed to surface or subsurface pores, the closure of these pores may play an additional role in improving the fatigue properties. While more work remains to unravel the relative importance of near-surface porosity compared to the compressive residual stress effect, this work clearly shows the effect of LSP-closing of pores near the surface. For the processing conditions demonstrated here, all pores up to 0.7 mm from the surface are closed without damaging the surface, while higher peening power results in surface damage.',\n",

AR is spotlighted as expected to provide much more immersive and realistic experience than ordinary displays. However, there are several barriers to be overcome for successful commercialization of AR. Here, we explore challenging and important topics for AR such as image combiners, enhancement of display performance, and focus cue reproduction. Image combiners are essential to integrate virtual images with real-world. Display performance (e.g. field of view and resolution) is important for more immersive experience and focus cue reproduction may mitigate visual fatigue caused by vergence-accommodation conflict. We also demonstrate emerging technologies to overcome these issues: index-matched anisotropic crystal lens (IMACL), retinal projection displays, and 3D display with focus cues. For image combiners, a novel optical element called IMACL provides relatively wide field of view. Retinal projection displays may enhance field of view and resolution of AR displays. Focus cues could be reconstructed via multi-layer displays and holographic displays. Experimental results of our prototypes are explained.',\n",

This study investigated how the manufacturing methods and the material used during powder bed fusion affects the compressive strength and high cycle fatigue strength of a stochastic porous material for a given stiffness. Specimens were manufactured using varying laser parameters, 3 scan strategies (Contour, Points, Pulsing) and 4 materials. The materials investigated were two titanium alloys: commercially pure grade 2 (CP-Ti) and Ti6Al4V ELI, commercially pure tantalum (Ta) and a titanium-tantalum alloy (Ti-30Ta). The trends observed during fatigue testing for monolithic metals and statically for solid and porous AM materials were not always indicative of the high cycle fatigue behaviour of porous AM materials. Unlike their solid counterparts, porous tantalum and the titanium-tantalum alloy had the greatest fatigue strength for a given stiffness, 8% greater than CP-Ti and 19% greater than Ti6Al4V ELI. Optimisation of the laser parameters and scan strategies was found to also increase the fatigue strength for a given stiffness of porous AM materials by 7-8%.',\n",

Due to the fact that conventional manufacturing technologies feature design and machining restrictions AM processes offer a nearly restriction free design freedom. This fact could be an answer to the permanent increase in demands of today's products. However, additive manufactured parts suffer from bad surface quality and the material properties concerning fatigue life are still an objective of current investigations. As a first step to describe the Life Cycle of additive manufactured parts fundamental knowledge about the dynamical fatigue behavior in operation has to be obtained. In comparison to conventional machined products this knowledge is not available to this extent for additive manufactured products. It is crucial to ensure that AM parts have a comparable or better high cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior compared to conventional machined parts for the potential future use as dynamical loaded parts in the aviation industry and medical technology such as turbine blades or implants. We investigate additive manufactured parts concerning the HCF behavior and surface quality. The parts are machined with Selective Laser Melting and then investigated concerning surface roughness and fatigue life. Also different finishing processes after the AM process are investigated in order to find out how different process chains influence the HCF behavior of additive manufactured parts.

The current paper aims to review the achievements in AM of steels in its ability to obtain superior properties that cannot be achieved through conventional manufacturing routes, thanks to the unique microstructural evolution in AM. The challenges that AM encounters are also reviewed, and suggestions for overcoming these challenges are provided if applicable. We focus on laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition as these two methods are currently the most common AM methods to process steels. The main foci are on austenitic stainless steels and maraging/precipitation-hardened (PH) steels, the two so far most widely used classes of steels in AM, before summarising the state-of-the-art of AM of other classes of steels. Our comprehensive review highlights that a wide range of steels can be processed by AM. The unique microstructural features including hierarchical (sub)grains and fine precipitates induced by AM result in enhancements of strength, wear resistance and corrosion resistance of AM steels when compared to their conventional counterparts. Achieving an acceptable ductility and fatigue performance remains a challenge in AM steels. AM also acts as an intrinsic heat treatment, triggering 'in situ' phase transformations including tempering and other precipitation phenomena in different grades of steels such as PH steels and tool steels. A thorough discussion of the performance of AM steels as a function of these unique microstructural features is presented in this review.\",\n",

Then, multiple models commonly used in the literature to predict porosity were examined and compared with the experimental data. Using the developed porosity model, a fatigue life prediction framework was adapted, and the predictions were compared to the previously published experimental data.

Specimens were subjected to three-point bending and SEM experiments to study their flexural and microstructural behavior. Results shown that: the flexural strengths of OR and NY 3D PPL reinforced CBC specimens were larger than TR and non-3D-PPL (N-3D-PPL) reinforced ones. But TR 3D PPL reinforcement effect was not so vibrant. For an ideal flexural strength, the best type and shape of 3D PPL were OR and rhombus, respectively. The deflection of 3D-PPL reinforced CBC specimens was larger than those N-3D PPL reinforced ones. For an ideal deflection value, the optimal shape and 3D PPL types were cube and OR. 3D PPL reinforced CBC specimens exhibited great ductility and toughness while N-3D PPL reinforced ones exhibited obvious brittleness.

The aim of the study was to compare additive and subtractive fabricated CAD/CAM mandibular reconstruction plates as well as conventional plates with regard to their biomechanical properties. Methods: In a chewing simulator, plates of 2 conventional locking plate systems and 2 CAD/CAM-fabricated plate systems were compared. The plates were loaded in a fatigue test. The maximum number of cycles until plate fracture and the plate stiffness were compared. Results: While all conventional plates fractured at a maximum load between 150 and 210 N (Newton) after a number of cycles between 40 000 and 643 000, none of the CAD/CAM plates broke despite a nearly doubled load of 330 N and 2 million cycles. Both CAD/CAM systems proved to be significantly superior to the hand-bent plates. There was no difference between the 2 CAD/CAM systems.

The OASLM is based on the photochromic protein, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), immobilized in a thin gelatin film (80 mu m). The photochromism of this material facilitates the light-induced switching of the optical absorption properties of the film. In this manner, the film can dynamically be switched between a purple-colored state and a yellow-colored state within 50 mu s. Furthermore, this material is capable of more than 10(8) read-erase cycles without showing any sign of fatigue. This monochrome system (purple graphics on a yellow background) is very suitable for radar displays, due to the high contrast of the projected images. Other possible applications include public information displays in airports and railway stations. The advantages of this projection system can be summarized as: (1) flicker-free graphics due to the temporal response of the OASLM causing no eye fatigue, (2) due to the molecular nature of the photochromic process, the spatial resolution is only limited by the scanners (no pixels) and projection lens, (3) as a result of the dynamic process in the OASLM, the system can be used at different ambient light levels by simply altering the intensity of the write laser and the read projection lamp simultaneously, and (4) highly efficient use of the power from the projection lamp because it actively pumps the photochromic process.',\n",

Crosslinking was done with different dosages of irradiation followed by melting. For one irradiation dose (50 kGy) extrusion and molding processes were compared. A fracture mechanics approach was used to determine how the degree of cross-linking affects resistance to crack propagation in ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Fatigue crack propagation resistance was reduced in proportion to the irradiation dose. The type of irradiation (gamma or electron beam) or manufacturing method (extrusion or molding) did not affect fatigue crack propagation resistance.

This makes PBF techniques attractive to many modern manufacturing sectors (e.g. aerospace, defence, energy and automotive) where some materials, such as Nickel-based superalloys, cannot be easily processed using conventional subtractive techniques. Nickelbased superalloys are crucial materials in modern engineering and underpin the performance of many advanced mechanical systems. Their physical properties (high mechanical integrity at high temperature) make them difficult to process via traditional techniques. Consequently, manufacture of nickel-based superalloys using PBF platforms has attracted significant attention. To permit a wider application, a deep understanding of their mechanical behaviour and relation to process needs to be achieved. The motivation for this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the mechanical properties of PBF nickel-based superalloys and how process parameters affect these, and to aid practitioners in identifying the shortcomings and the opportunities in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to review research contributions regarding the microstructure and mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys, manufactured using the two principle PBF techniques: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM). The 'target' microstructures are introduced alongside the characteristics of those produced by PBF process, followed by an overview of the most used building processes, as well as build quality inspection techniques.

However, the fatigue performance, including crack initiation and crack propagation of AM gas turbine material, is not fully known. In addition, AM materials shows anisotropic properties due to the columnar grain growth in the building direction during the AM process, which needs to be accounted for. Also, an AM component often solidifies with a cellular dendritic structure during the manufacturing process. In the present study, the bulk material of an AM adopted nickel-based superalloy based on Hastelloy X was subjected to low-cycle fatigue (LCF) loading at room temperature. The LCF tests were conducted in strain control on additively manufactured smooth bars,with two different build orientations (with an angle of 0 degrees and 90 degrees relative to the building platform). The LCF results showed that the major part of the fatigue life is spent in the crack initiation phase, namely 78% to 99% of the total fatigue life. Based on the experiments, a model to predict the crack initiation life was developed that takes the anisotropic material behaviour into account. The last part of the fatigue life, the crack propagation phase, was studied on a microstructural level, where initial fractography of the ruptured LCF specimens revealed that the dendritic structure was visible on the fracture surface. It was noted that the dendritic structure could easily be mistaken for regular striations although they represent a different fracture mechanism. The fracture surfaces were therefore cross sectioned and possible correlations between fracture surface characteristics and underlying microstructure were studied using electron backscatter diffraction and electron channelling contrast imaging. The outcome showed that the dendritic structure had some effect on the LCF crack propagation behaviour by interdendritic tearing, which was discussed.',\n",

By employing PDMS@rGO framework as dielectric layer and spacer, a force-electric coupling model was built to investigate the electromechanical sensing mechanism. Owing to the ultra-low Young's modulus of the 3D-printed materials and designed device structure, the rGO-TPS can reach the sensitivity of 6.28 kPa-1 and broaden highsensitivity region from 0.65 Pa to 10 kPa. Besides, it also improves the sensitivity to 0.61 kPa-1 during the large pressure range from 10 kPa to 140 kPa. It also illustrates a fast response time of 92 ms and great stability of 3,000 cycles without fatigue. In addition, the dynamic pressure response can be monitored by detecting the change of pulse-like short-circuit current signal. Benefiting from the structural advantages and ultra-high performance, several potential applications in gauging water droplets and air flows, and vibration recognition have also been successfully demonstrated.

Nonetheless, the physical and mechanical properties of such hydrogels require further characterization to evaluate their long-term integrity and stability to avoid implant compaction and aneurysm recurrence over time. To that end, molecular weight and polymer content of the hydrogels were tuned to match the elastic modulus and compliance of aneurysmal tissue while minimizing the swelling volume and pressure.

The hydrogels were then exposed to a fatigue test under physiological pulsatile flow, inducing a combination of circumferential and shear stresses. The hydrogels withstood 5.5 million cycles and no significant weight loss of the implant was observed nor did the polymerized hydrogel protrude or migrate into the parent artery. Slight surface erosion defects of 2-10 mu m in depth were observed after loading compared to 2 mu m maximum for non-loaded hydrogels.

These industries have fatigue-limited applications, but a lack of understanding of the EBM process-microstructure-fatigue relationships limit widespread use and presents challenges for certification. In this review, uniaxial fatigue data was collected and the effects of build orientation, surface roughness, and hot-isostatic pressing are linked to the fatigue properties highlighting microstructure, defects, and failure mechanisms. The observations and conclusions are supported by statistical analysis using the mean fatigue life obtained by the Statistical Fatigue-Limit Model. Both EBM-process and post-process structure relationships are discussed in order to identify the best-practice for fatigue-resistant design. The performance of the EBM material is compared to conventionally manufactured Ti-6Al-4V and possible methods to increase the fatigue resistance are discussed. Anisotropic fatigue behavior was observed in as-fabricated parts and no statistical distinction was found in the fatigue performance of HIPed and as-fabricated material provided the same as-fabricated rough surface condition. However, comparable fatigue life to traditionally manufactured lamellar Ti-6Al-4V is achieved when both post-process HIP and machining are applied to EBM-fabricated parts.',\n",

       " ['The implementation of nano-additives in machining fluid is significant for manufacturers to attain a sustainable manufacturing process. The material removal rate (MRR) is a significant process of transforming solid raw materials into specific shapes and sizes. This process has many challenges due to friction, vibration, chip discontinuity when machining aluminum alloy, which has led to poor accuracy and affected the fatigue life of the developed material. It is worth noting that aluminum 8112 alloy is currently being applied in most engineering applications due to its lightweight-to-strength ratio compared to some other metals. This research aims to compare the effects of copra oil-based-titanium dioxide (TiO2)- and Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs)-nano-lubricant with cutting parameter interactions by conducting a study on MRR for advanced machining of aluminum 8112 alloys. The biodegradable nano-additive-lubricants were developed using two-step preparation techniques. The study employed a quadratic rotatable central composite design (QRCCD) to carry out the interaction study of the five machining parameters in the three lubrication environments on MRR. The results show that the copra-based-TiO2 nano-lubricant increases the MRR by 7.5% and 16% than the MWCNTs and copra-oil-lubrication machining environments, respectively. In conclusion, the eco-friendly nano-additive-lubricant TiO2-Copra oil-based should be applied to manufacture machine parts for high entropy applications for sustainable production systems.',\n",

       " [\"Fully dense titanium alloy implants have long been used for the replacement and stabilization of damaged bone tissue. Nevertheless, they can cause stress shielding which brings to a loss of bone mass. Additive manufacturing (AM) allows obtaining highly porous cellular structures with a wide range of cell morphologies to tune the mechanical properties to match that of the patient's bone. In this work, the fully reversed fatigue strength of cellular specimens produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of Ti-6A1-4V alloy was measured. Their structures are determined by cubic cells packed in six different ways and their elastic modulus is roughly 3GPa to match that of trabecular bone. Part of the specimens was left as sintered and part treated by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). The fatigue resistance of such AM parts can be affected by surface morphology, geometrical accuracy as well as internal defects. Micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used in this work to compare the geometry of the produced specimens with the CAD model and to carry out residual stress measurements using the Plasma FIB-SEM-DIC micro-hole drilling method.

First of all, optimized processing parameters for 3D Ti-5Al-2.5Sn components were determined through single track and single layer formation processes. After that, near full-dense parts with different sizes were successfully built up and their microstructures as well as texture features were in-depth analyzed employing optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer and electron back-scattered diffraction. Because of the rapid cooling rate inherent to selective laser melting technology and the absence of beta-stabilizing elements, as-deposited Ti-5Al-2.5Sn possesses an overwhelmingly acicular alpha' martensitic structure with a small amount of a grains discontinuously precipitated at the prior-beta grain boundaries, making it exhibit higher strength/hardness but poorer elongation/impact toughness in comparison to the deformed and as-cast Ti-5Al-2.5Sn. The overall texture is found to be nearly random after SLM. As a result, mechanical behaviors of the as-built Ti-5Al-2.5Sn are isotropous. Under the interaction between the residual pores and the overwhelmingly martensitic microstructure, as-deposited sample presents better fatigue performance than the forged Ti-5Al-2.5Sn at a high peak cyclic stress of beyond 700 MPa. Nevertheless, the opposite situation occurs when the peak cyclic stress is lower than 700 MPa.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\",\n",

Material was tested both parallel and perpendicular (transverse) to the build direction. In all instances, the EBM HIP and heat-treated Inconel 718 performed similarly or exceeded the LCF life of wrought Inconel 718 plate and bar stock under fully reversed strain-controlled loading at 650 degrees C. Amongst the textures, the columnar grains oriented parallel to the build direction exhibited the highest life on average compared to the transverse columnar and equiax EBM material. Further, in relation to the reference wrought material the parallel columnar grain material exhibited a greater life. While a negligible life difference was observed in the equiax grained material between the two orientations, a consistently lower accumulated inelastic strain was measured for the material loaded parallel to the build direction than the transverse orientation. Failure of the parallel columnar material occurred in a transgranular manner with cracks emanating from the surface whereas the transverse columnar material failed in a intergranular manner, with crack growth occurring through repeated rupture of oxide at the crack-tip. In the case of the equiax material, an influence of material orientation was not observed on the failure mechanism with crack propagation occurring through a combination of debondedicracked carbides and void formation along twin boundaries resulting in a mixture of intergranular and transgranular crack propagation.

       " ['The diffusion of design tools suitable for regular lattice structures was recently stimulated by the spread of additive manufacturing technologies that enable the fabrication of complex geometries, exceeding the limits of traditional manufacturing methods. Fillet radii play a fundamental role in the design of lattice materials, reducing the stress concentration and improving fatigue life. However, only simplified beam and 2D models are available in the literature, which are unable to capture the actual stiffness and stress concentrations in the cell nodes of the 3-D beam based lattice structures with fillets. In this paper, four types of polyamide 12 cells, fabricated by selective laser sintering technology, based on cylindrical elements, are studied by finite element (FE) analysis, evaluating the influence of struts and fillet radii on the mechanical properties. In order to study a single cell, specific boundary conditions, simulating the presence of adjacent cells, were adopted in FE analysis. As a result, a model describing mechanical properties as a function of geometrical characteristics is obtained. By this model, it is possible to replace the complex shape of a lattice structure with its boundary, simplifying numerical analyses. This approach, called homogenization, is very useful in the design process of lightweight structures and can be adopted in optimization strategies. Numerical outcomes show that the effect of fillet radius is not negligible, especially in cells having a large number of struts. Moreover, experimental tests were also carried out showing a good agreement with the numerical analysis. Finally, an interactive design process for lattice structures based on experimental and numerical outcomes is proposed.',\n",

Cycloplegia is paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye, resulting in a loss of accommodation. Here, we present a reversible cycloplegia case caused by duloxetine use. The patient was a 24 years-old woman with MDD diagnosis. Patient had somatic symptoms like fatigue, myalgia, and headache, besides her depressive symptoms for the last two months. Escitalopram and sertraline were used for her MDD before and she had to quit both owing to side effects such as nausea and drowsiness. Duloxetine 30mg/day treatment was started in our outpatient clinic. In her first follow-up exam, she reported light sensitivity and increased visual impairment. The visual impairment led dizziness and an increase in headache. She was consulted to ophthalmology unit of our hospital and cycloplegia was detected in her eye examination. Duloxetine was stopped in the ninth day of treatment but cycloplegia negatively affected the patient's daily life for almost 4 weeks and impaired her functionality. Because of the paralysis of the ciliary muscle, the curvature of the lens can no longer be adjusted to focus on nearby objects. Eye pain, changes in vision and swelling or redness in or around the eye are mentioned as possible visual side effects in the medication of duloxetine. The ocular and visual side effects from a patient's systemic medication can range from mild to severe. These side effects may or may not be serious enough to warrant discontinuing treatment. Cycloplegia seems as a rare adverse effect in antidepressant treatment and may take a long time to wash out. Recognition of ocular and visual side effects is important to prevent and minimize serious complications. In such visual disturbances, eye examination of the patient should be performed and the responsible drug should be discontinued as early as possible.\",\n",

The properties of products manufactured using this technique depend upon large number of factors, with print orientation being one among the most important factors. Currently, there is no standard for the build orientation of the printed component. To date, the analysis of material properties is conducted by testing specimens printed in different orientations. The present work explores the effect of layer orientations on the different mechanical properties of an SLA manufactured polymer material. Five different orientations, i.e. 0 degrees, 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, 67.5 degrees and 90 degrees were used to print the specimens for the analysis of mechanical properties of the material. Tensile, compression, flexural, impact, fatigue and vibration analysis are the different mechanical tests that were conducted as per their respective standards. It was found that the print orientation plays a significant role in the behaviour of the respective mechanical property. The maximum tensile and compressive load are being taken by the specimens printed at an angle of 22.5 degrees and 67.5 degrees, respectively. The specimen printed at 67.5 degrees orientation again have highest flexural strength, whereas the specimen printed at 0 degrees have higher impact and fatigue strength.',\n",

Therefore, possible applications are direct production of casting molds, tools or turbine blades with internal cooling channels for an optimized cooling efficiency. A disadvantage of the technology is the process-inherent surface roughness, which is critical especially under fatigue loading conditions. Since internal surfaces often cannot be smoothened due to limited accessibility, the objective of this study is to assess the fatigue properties of Ti-6Al-4V samples designed with internal axial channels featuring a rough as-built surface. Samples with various diameters and numbers of channels have been tested not always exhibiting a deterioration of the fatigue performance compared to solid samples. Subsequent fractography by scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct failure mechanisms. Besides the fatigue crack initiation on features of the unmodified internal surfaces, residual porosity in the bulk, i.e. lack-of-fusion defects, keyhole defects and gas pores, respectively, could be identified as crack origin. Relatively low scatter of fatigue lives found is attributed to rapid crack initiation and, thus, the dominant influence of the (micro-) crack growth regime. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the calculation of Ni and Cr equivalents in the LMDed SS304 specimen and the analytical results of electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), the phase compositions of the LMDed SS304 specimen are evaluated. The hardness of the LMDed specimen is compared with that of the conventionally manufactured wrought SS304 and SLMed specimens. And due to the differences of the grain size and phase composition on the different directions, the hardness of the LMDed specimen is anisotropic. The static tensile properties (ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (sigma(0.2)) and elongation (EL)) and fatigue strength (FS) of the LMDed specimen are compared with those of the specimens made by the traditional method and SLM. The S-N curve is established by the multiple experiments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is applied to observe the fracture morphology of the static tension and tension-compression fatigue tests.

Particle size distribution (PSD) and shape factors influence flowability as well as the thickness and uniformity of each powder layer in the build box. For high-performance applications such as aerospace, medical, power generation and military, it becomes important to identify critical additional factors: the types, numbers and sizes of particulate contaminants that may be present in the powder. This is true for virgin, used and blended powders. Contaminants may be introduced during powder manufacture (e.g., ceramic insulation fragments from gas atomization equipment), handling (building insulation, talc) or possibly during the build process itself. Contaminants contained within a batch of powder can be physically built into an additive part when they are incorporated into the melt pool, and they can remain as discrete particulates or non-fused interfaces that act as stress concentrators. Their presence may decrease fatigue life by increasing the likelihood of fatigue crack initiation. This article describes three methods to rapidly and quantifiably characterize powder feedstock. (1) Computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) provides quantitative size and shape parameters, as well as fine surface details from individual images on a particle-by-particle basis in large populations of powder. (2) Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) can be included, providing insights into variations within a batch of powder, as well as contaminant compositions. (3) For critical applications, the heavy liquid separation (HLS) method physically extracts low-density contaminants from a sample of powder metal down to part-per-billion detection limits to allow direct examination of contaminants and enhance identification and prevention of their sources. Altogether, these methods permit direct comparisons among powder metal samples. Better quantification of powder characteristics aids determination of suitability for end uses.',\n",

Large columnar grain with a cellular structure in the grain interior and Laves/delta phases precipitated along the grain boundaries were exhibited in the SLM alloy, while fine equiaxed grains were present in the wrought alloy. The elevated temperature had a minor effect on the fatigue resistance in the regime below 10(8) cycles for the SLM alloy but significantly reduced the fatigue strength in the VHCF regime above 10(8) cycles.

In a VHCF regime above 10(7)-10(8) cycles at elevated temperature, the wrought material exhibited slightly better fatigue resistance than the SLM alloy.

Manipulating rigid instruments through these constrained spaces makes this approach technically challenging, and thus, a handheld robotic instrument could expand the surgeon's capabilities. In this study, we present an intuitive handle prototype for such a robotic instrument. Methods We have designed and fabricated a surgical instrument handle prototype that maps the surgeon's wrist directly to the robot joints. To alleviate the surgeon's wrist of any excessive strain and fatigue, the tool is mounted on the surgeon's forearm, making it parallel with the instrument's shaft. To evaluate the handle's performance and limitations, we constructed a surgical task simulator and compared our novel handle with a standard neurosurgical tool, with the tasks being performed by a consultant neurosurgeon. Results While using the proposed handle, the surgeon's average success rate was 80%, compared to 41% when using a conventional tool. Additionally, the surgeon's body posture while using the suggested prototype was deemed acceptable by the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment ergonomic survey, while early results indicate the absence of a learning curve. Conclusions Based on these preliminary results, the proposed handle prototype could offer an improvement over current neurosurgical tools and procedural ergonomics. By redirecting forces applied during the procedure to the forearm of the surgeon, and allowing for intuitive surgeon wrist to robot-joints movement mapping without compromising the robotic end effector's expanded workspace, we believe that this handle could prove a substantial step toward improved neurosurgical instrumentation.\",\n",

Cylindrical fatigue specimens were manufactured by EBM and SLM and tested in differently post-treated conditions. The EBM specimens were tested in the as-built condition, SLM manufactured specimens were heat treated at 800 degrees C and hot isostatically pressed, respectively. The type, size and location of every crack initiating discontinuity was determined and thoroughly investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Three main findings were derived from the present investigation. Fatigue properties of as-built EBM and stress relieved SLM specimens in the HCF and VHCF regimes are very similar. Defect types and defect sizes of similar nature were observed in both conditions. In consequence, stress relieving heat treatment has not to be conducted in EBM processed Ti-6Al-4V. The shape of the discontinuities, however, currently is not considered by traditional approaches for estimation of fatigue strength. The fatigue performance of the SLM processed and subsequently hot isostatically pressed condition is superior to its two additively manufactured counterparts and similar to conventionally processed material.

While several techniques exist, they all require significant commitment of staff time and resources. In veterinary medicine, canine-specific techniques and strategies have been adapted and delivered but deemed not realistically clinically implementable given the time commitment of over 2.5 h plus per fraction or have been relegated to palliative intent. Leveraging these technologies of helical tomotherapy and 3D printing, we developed and clinically implemented a radiotherapeutic treatment strategy for the management of medically refractory diffuse cutaneous lymphoma in the dog. Case presentation A 13.5-year-old female spayed Bichon Frise presented to the Oncology service at Texas A&M University, College of Veterinary Medicine due to the progression of diffuse cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma (CEL) that had failed medical management. Twenty-seven gray were delivered to the patient with a treatment time requirement under 40 min including real time monitoring of anesthesia during setup and treatment. A partial response was noticeable after four fractions and the tumor completely regressed progressively over the entire treated area by the end of therapy. A grade 1 lethargy, fatigue, weight loss, and oral mucositis and grade 2 alopecia, nail/claw changes, pruritus, scaling, anorexia, and diarrhea were noted during treatment. Additionally, a grade 3 thrombocytopenia developed after fraction eight requiring a treatment interruption of 6 weeks and prescription modification prior to treatment continuation and completion. From the beginning of total skin photon radiation therapy (TSPT) treatment until the time of the patient was euthanized unrelated to cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma (123 days), only one new lesion on the head was identified and confirmed by histopathology within the treated fields.

These materials have unique properties, such as high resistance to mechanical and chemical degradation when exposed to high temperatures. Furthermore, when these alloys are used to produce hybrid components with other similar alloys, investigating their surface integrity is critical because any residual stress can lead to early stage cracks and poor fatigue performance. In this research, a hybrid manufacturing approach is employed to produce components from difficult to weld alloys, i.e. CM247LC deposited on IN718 through a laser based direct energy deposition (L-DED) process. The surface integrity, mechanical properties and microstructure of such hybrid components is investigated, especially their welding/joint areas. Crack-free processing regimes were established to deposit CM247LC while mitigating the negative effects onto the microstructure of the Inconel substrate. Especially, the thermal gradients were managed to deliver crack free sections of CM247LC with good interface bonding, strength and fine microstructure. It is important to note that this is achieved without any significant preheating that contrasts with what is reported in other investigations so far. Furthermore, end-use hybrid blisks with deposited CM247LC blades onto Inconel 718 disks (HUB) were manufactured and then machined within a single processing set-up. The results show that the substrate thickness, the machining between the deposited layers and the final machining and heat-treatment play a role in reducing residual stresses. Ultimately, such hybrid manufacturing approach can be considered a new solution for producing such components and also for their subsequent repair.',\n",

However, the microstructure evolution of LPBF metallic materials during fatigue deformation and its influence on fatigue properties remain still unclear. This paper systematically investigated the microstructural evolution and deformation behavior of LPBF 304L austenitic stainless steel (ASS) during tensile and fatigue testing. Experimental results indicated that LPBF 304L ASS exhibited superior tensile and fatigue properties compared with its annealed counterparts, which could be attributed to different deformation mechanisms. The superior tensile properties were commonly attributed to the regulation of cell walls on the dislocation flow. Many fine alpha '-martensite particles were distributed in the gamma-austenite matrix grains of fatigue-fractured LPBF 304L ASS, indicating the occurrence of martensitic transformation during cyclic deformation. The cell walls with strong chemical misfits and high coherent internal stress might provide the non-parallel lattice shear forces for alpha '-martensite nucleation during cyclic deformation. The martensitic transformation could inhibit the cyclic softening and postpone the strain localization, thus contributing to the remarkable prolongation of the steady stage and the significant improvement of fatigue lifetime. Collectively, this study established the microstructural evolution role in regulating the tensile and fatigue deformation of LPBF 304L ASS.\",\n",

       " [\"The ability of processing through laser beams different kinds of metallic powders for direct production of 3D components with complex geometries has been gaining an impressive and growing attention for specific industrial applications. The process which can be distinguished as Selective Laser Sintering or Selective Laser Melting is even considered, more generally, as Additive Manufacturing where layer by layer material is built by the interaction between a laser beam and a powder bed. The rapid heating of the powder due to the laser beam energy transfer process followed by a rapid cooling rate induces within the manufactured material a cellular structure with fine sub-grains, which are in the range of few hundreds of micrometers. These metastable structures, which are smaller than the grain size in conventionally manufactured 316L stainless steel components, can undertake towards a recrystallization process due to either heat or mechanical treatments. For instance, when sub-grain boundaries of the cells are enriched with Mo and higher concentration of dislocation, dynamical processes occur generating local residual stresses. In these circumstances the segregation of Mo in cell boundaries is out of thermodynamic equilibrium conditions so that microstructures and phases are metastable. In the range of 1100-1400 degrees C heat treatments a complete dissolution of Mo in the Fe matrix with a gradual disappearance of sub-microns cell is observed feeding the growth of larger austenitic sub-grains formation. It follows a higher degree of Mo dissolution in the material matrix and a decrease of dislocation's concentration (Saeidi et al., 2015) [1]. In the work here presented we point out which are the microstructural features of stainless steel 316L components realized by Additive Manufacturing. Furthermore, the occurrence of a microstructural evolution is presented after experiencing to fatigue of 80000 cycles some door joints obtained by this technique. A decrease of dislocation's number, an increase of twinning due to the growth of grains and to the release of local stresses can be hypothesized following that an important role could be played by the presence of dislocations in cell boundaries as well as oxides nano-inclusion formed in-situ during the Additive Manufacturing process (Saeidi et al., 2015) [2]. From these outcomes it is going to be presented how the 3D components produced by Additive Manufacturing could change and improve their features for potential industrial applications during life cycles and enhance such a behavior by taking carefully into account the laser parameters and its scanning speed.

It was aimed at providing a mean to point out multiple early valve's damages. To achieve the goal, the study was proposed to handle via three main phases. They included (i) the risk point determinations, (ii) the new valve design and the crack nucleation life estimations, as well as (iii) the simplified crack growth analyses. The obtained results firstly highlighted the construction of the test channel (TC), whose branches were located close to the predicted damage's sites. The damages could be identified either when a crack reaches the TC (then forms a leakage) or indirectly via the crack propagations' correlation. The results also pointed out that the TC-implemented valve could perform as similarly as the non-TC one in the non-treated condition. More importantly, this new structure was proved to have a capacity of satisfying the required minimal life of 1.5E5 cycles, depending on the combined uses of the specific material and the pre-treatment, among those considered. In addition, the results emphasized the complexity of the TC that could not be formed by the traditional manufacturing process. Hence, direct metal laser sintering was proposed for the associated prototype and the final TC was issued based on the fundamental requirements of the technique. Finally, it was suggested that practical experiments should essentially be carried out to yield more evidence to support the demonstrated results.\",\n",

The approach is based on application of thermography on specimen that is step-by-step increasingly loaded. Detected temperature changes at different stress levels are evaluated and final fatigue limit level is determined.. Thermography analysis seems to have a great potential to reduce the material demand and to achieve the minimum testing time while the quality of test results remains comparable to standard approach. This is extremely useful in cases where the experimental material is strictly limited, such as new materials development, residual service life of in-service components determination or also, nowadays, for additive manufacturing components, where specimens preparation is expensive. Each specimen was tested at different stress amplitudes, where the test procedure consists of at least 8 loading steps. Results obtained with the thermography technique were compared with those obtained from standard high-cycle force-controlled fatigue tests under constant loading until failure in accordance with the ASTM E466-07 standard All tests were done at room temperature with the cycle asymmetry coefficient R =-1.

AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM.

While the inertness of Ar is often desirable as the shield gas from unwanted chemical reactions, its low solubility combined with the violent nature of the melt pool inevitably result in the formation of defects that are detrimental to the fatigue performance of the alloy. On the other hand, although N-2 is reactive with some alloys (e.g. titanium), it may have remarkable favorable effects on the mechanical properties and fatigue performance of 17-4 PH SS. In this article, the advantageous effects of N-2 as an in-process micro-/defect-structure refiner of LB-PBF 17-4 PH SS, and in turn, an enhancer of its mechanical/fatigue properties are demonstrated. It is shown that, compared to Ar, the use of N-2 shield gas induces more retained austenite, refines grains, makes the melt pools deeper, produces fewer and smaller pores, and as a result, slightly improves tensile properties, moderately improves crack growth resistance, and considerably improves axial fatigue properties in the high cycle regime.',\n",

In this paper, the failure analysis on the crack of ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) solder joints is revealed with the aid of 3D X-ray inspection, microsection technique, optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The result of 3D X-ray shows that voids were found in the CBGA and no obvious cracks in joints were detected. By employing micro-section technique, micro-cracks were found in several CBGA solder joints with aid of OM and SEM. The result of micro-section of CBGA solder joints also reveals that the solder balls were made of eutectic tin-lead alloys. The OM and SEM images of cross-section of CBGA solder joints demonstrated that significant coarsening of solder structure was found near the cracks. In the CBGA solder joints, Pb-rich phase was well distributed into the Sn-rich. The size of Pb-rich phase in the crack area was larger than that in other area of the solder joints. As the size of microstructure increased, the interfaces between different phases decreased, which would weaken the mechanical structure of the solder joints, leading to crack failure eventually. It can be inferred that the crack of CBGA solder joints was related to thermal-mechanical fatigue. Generally, the thermal expansion of ceramic is much smaller than that of PCB substrate, which led to large thermal mismatch during the thermal cycling test, causing the thermal mechanical fatigue crack in the CBGA solder joints. The intermetallic compound (IMC) at the soldering interface and the shape of solder joints were also observed by SEM. The IMC showed a continuous morphology with proper thickness, and the solder joints kept a normal shape. In this paper, the cross section of plastic ball grid array (PBGA) solder joints on the same printed circuit board (PCB) were also observed by OM and SEM. However, no thermal mechanical fatigue cracks and coarsening of solder structure were found. It was due to that the coefficient of thermal expansion of PBGA substrate is similar to that of PCB substrate, and that the thermal mismatch between the PBGA and PCB was much smaller than that between the CBGA and PCB. Hence, thermal-mechanical fatigue cracks were found in CBGA solder joints, while the PBGA solder joints remained intact. This paper also reveals that the height of solder joint can significantly influent the reliability of the CBGA joints under the thermal cycling load.',\n",

In this study, the influence of LSP on the microstructure and fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured via electron beam melting (EBM), a popular method of AM, was investigated. The microstructure of the EBM sample consisted of the beta phase (similar to 6 vol%) and alpha lamellar phase. Grain refinement of the alpha phase occurred via both dislocation evolution and deformation twinning during LSP. A theoretical description of the microstructural evolution, particularly the distribution of deformation twins, was developed. The fatigue strength and micro-hardness of the EBM samples increased by approximately 17% and 11% after LSP treatment, respectively. The fatigue fracture morphologies at three defined damage stages (crack initiation, crack propagation, and instantaneous rupture) were examined for EBM samples before and after LSP. The dominant mechanism of fatigue strength enhancement by LSP was discussed. The effects of residual compressive stress assistant with adiabatic temperature increase and grain refinement of the alpha phase produced by LSP reduced the pre-existing crack size, suppressed crack initiation, and increased the required work for fatigue fracture.',\n",

To evaluate the efficacy of a novel variant of electroencephalograph biofeedback, the Low Energy Neurofeedback System (LENS), that utilizes minute pulses of electromagnetic stimulation to change brainwave activity for the amelioration of fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms. Design. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting. Tertiary referral academic medical center, outpatient. Patients. Thirty-four patients diagnosed with FM according to 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Interventions. Active or sham LENS, depending on randomization, for 22 treatment sessions. Outcome Measures. Primary outcome measure was the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire total score. Secondary outcome measures included number of tender points (TPs) and pressure required to elicit TPs on physical examination, quantitative sensory testing heat pain threshold, and self-reported cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, sleep problems, global psychological distress, and depression obtained at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results. Participants who received the active or sham interventions improved (Ps < 0.05) on the primary and a variety of secondary outcome measures, without statistically significant between group differences in evidence at post-treatment or 3- or 6-month follow-up. Individual session self-reported ratings of specific symptoms (cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, pain, and sleep, and overall activity level) over the course of the 22 intervention sessions indicated significant linear trends for improvement for the active intervention condition only (Ps < 0.05). Conclusion. LENS cannot be recommended as a single modality treatment for FM. However, further study is warranted to investigate the potential of LENS to interact synergistically with other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for improving symptoms in FM.',\n",

Based on the SEM analysis of the tested parts, correlations between results of the mechanical test and microstructure of the parts have been investigated. CFRAM components are lightweight yet strong materials with a wide range of potential applications in auto industry, aerospace, sport goods, and medical tools. CFRAM components benefit from both cutting-edge 3D printing technology and fiber reinforcement to improve mechanical properties. Produced parts have lightweight compared with metals, strong mechanical properties, and short manufacturing time.

Carbon fiber (CF), fiberglass (FG), and Kevlar were used as reinforcing agents, and nylon as the base material. Microstructural analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture mechanism, morphology, and printing quality of the specimens. It was observed that the main failing mechanisms for CFRAM components are fiber pull-out, fiber breakage, and delamination. Further, it was understood that there is a correlation between the fiber stacking density and mechanical properties.

The rapid development of these electronic systems that are flexible, stretchable, and/or wearable necessitates the concurrent development of robust mechanical and electrical test methods to improve their design and reliability. In this paper, one such mechanical test method is discussed in which a stretchable electronic test coupon is mounted onto an inflatable bladder of known geometry to induce multiaxial strains, while in-situ 4-point resistance measurement is employed to assess the device's performance and electromechanical integrity. The material combination of a stretchable screen-printed silver ink cured onto a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) substrate is studied given the proclivity for the use of TPU in wearable devices. A dome-shaped bladder configuration is employed in this work to study the performance of printed conductors under biaxial stretching. Various monotonic and cyclic loading regimes are employed to characterize the fatigue behavior and maximum use conditions of the samples. Volume of water displaced into the bladder during inflation is measured and correlated to the induced multiaxial strains on the mounted devices using 3D digital image correlation. Relationships between resistance and applied multiaxial strains are presented. Experimental results are compared with literature, and plausible extensions of the test method including direct printing on the bladder material are discussed.\",\n",

       " [\"When assessing the mechanical durability of electronic assemblies, the focus is generally on the solder interconnects. However, in many package styles, such as ball grid arrays (BGAs), land grid arrays (LGAs), micro lead frame (MLFs) and quad flat no-lead (QFNs), the Cu trace emanating from the solder pad may be the weakest failure site, especially if the solder joint is copper-defined rather than mask defined. This is particularly true in situations with cyclic mechanical loading, such as cyclic quasi-static bending, vibration and repetitive drop/shock. This study focuses on quasi-static mechanical cycling durability of LGA assemblies with copper-defined pads. Specimens were cycled to failure under zero-to-max, three-point bending and failure statistics were collected. The failure mode was confirmed to be fatigue cracks in copper traces emanating from the corner solder pads, just at the edge of the solder mask where the solder joint ends. The cracks were identified by lateral polishing after desoldering the component. The cyclic bending of this assembly was modeled with 3D, elastic-plastic, large deformation finite element analysis. Due to the complexity of the geometry, a global-local approach was used to identify the strain history and the mean stress at the failure site. A generalized strain-based fatigue model was used to characterize these failures, and preliminary model constants were iteratively estimated by ensuring that they were simultaneously compatible with both the durability test data and the copper stress-strain curves used in the FEA (finite element analysis). These preliminary model constants were then refined by separately modeling the initiation and progression history of fatigue damage in the cyclic bend tests. Damage progression was modeled in this study by using a technique of 'successive initiation' developed earlier by this research group. In this method, finite element simulations are used to progressively 'kill' elements that have accumulated sufficient fatigue damage to lose their load-carrying capacity. When the killed elements span the entire cross-section of the copper trace, the trace is assumed to electrically fail. This calibrated model is then used to demonstrate its ability to predict copper trace failures in other situations such as quasi-static four-point bending of LGA assemblies and vibration of BGA assemblies. More important, we demonstrate its use for re-designing of BGA assemblies to prevent copper trace failures under drop/shock loading. The important impact of this study includes insight into copper trace failures in Printed Wiring Assemblies (PWAs) under mechanical cycling, a quantitative model to predict its occurrence, and validated guidelines to prevent it by design.

The authors sought to determine how features of learners, patients/tasks, settings, and supervisors were associated with three types of cognitive load among learners performing a specific procedure, colonoscopy, to identify implications for procedural teaching. Method Data were collected through an electronically administered survey sent to 1,061 U.S. gastroenterology fellows during the 2014-2015 academic year; 477 (45.0%) participated. Participants completed the survey immediately following a colonoscopy. Using multivariable linear regression analyses, the authors identified sets of features associated with intrinsic, extraneous, and germane loads. Results Features associated with intrinsic load included learners (prior experience and year in training negatively associated, fatigue positively associated) and patient/tasks (procedural complexity positively associated, better patient tolerance negatively associated). Features associated with extraneous load included learners (fatigue positively associated), setting (queue order positively associated), and supervisors (supervisor engagement and confidence negatively associated). Only one feature, supervisor engagement, was (positively) associated with germane load. Conclusions These data support practical recommendations for teaching procedural skills through the lens of cognitive load theory. To optimize intrinsic load, level of experience and competence of learners should be balanced with procedural complexity; part-task approaches and scaffolding may be beneficial. To reduce extraneous load, teachers should remain engaged, and factors within the procedural setting that may interfere with learning should be minimized. To optimize germane load, teachers should remain engaged.',\n",

This was achieved by manufacturing test samples using Additive Manufacturing (AM). The samples were subsequently heat-treated in order to mimic the operating conditions of the engine and then evaluated experimentally for the presence of residual stresses. In order to incorporate these residual stresses into engine operating conditions, an ABAQUS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted to define stresses which are effective during operation. Subsequently, a fatigue software (Fe-safe) was used to determine the fatigue behavior of the bladed disk while taking into consideration the in-plane residual stresses. The results acquired from this study showed an average residual stress contribution of 70% towards the fatigue life estimated cycles to failure of engines undertaking short flight missions. As the flight time increases, the residual stress influence decreases due to stress relaxation. This study, therefore, concluded that the inclusion of in-plane residual stresses in fatigue life estimates is significant for turbine blades operating at short flight time intervals with less effect on long mission operations.',\n",

Methods: 13 of the confirmed carriers were interviewed and examined, and information about the remaining carrier was obtained from medical records. Clinical information about deceased individuals was obtained, when possible, from postmortem reports, death certificates and medical records. Results: There have been eight sudden deaths; the cause of death was aortic dissection in all six cases in which a postmortem examination was performed. Three individuals had undergone aortic replacement surgery. Dissection had occurred throughout the aorta, and in one case in the absence of aortic root dilatation. Subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to a ruptured berry aneurysm, had occurred in two individuals. Four gene carriers and one deceased family member who were investigated had tortuous cerebral blood vessels. One had tortuous vertebral arteries, two had tortuous carotid arteries and one a tortuous abdominal aorta. Two individuals were found to have a brachiocephalic artery aneurysm and a subclavian artery aneurysm, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the predisposition to aortic dilatation and dissection, individuals did not frequently manifest the skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, with the exception of joint hypermobility. No one individual had ocular lens dislocation. Striae and herniae were common. There was some overlap with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, OMIM 130050, with soft translucent skin, which is easily bruised. Other features were arthralgia, migraine and a tendency to fatigue easily, varicose veins and prominent skin striae.

Ultrasonic fatigue methodologies were used for the determination of an operative fatigue strength for lifetimes in the range of 10(8)-10(9) cycles. Fatigue crack growth rates were determined for small fatigue cracks that initiated and grew from artificially produced (FIB) surface defects in specimens subjected to ultrasonic fatigue. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used in an effort to detect possible crack initiation and growth in specimens cycled for fractions of the nominal VHCF fatigue strength. From the baseline fatigue experiments using fully reversed loading (R = - 1), a nominal fatigue strength of 90 MPa was established for lifetimes in the 10(8)-10(9) range, and this maximum stress value was used in subsequent crack growth and CT studies. Using ultrasonic fatigue allowed very slow average crack growth rates on the order of 10(-11) m/cycle at a degrees Delta K of 1.5 Mpa m(1/2). Small crack growth from FIB-produced micronotches appeared to be transgranular and non-crystallographic. While modest increase in size of some features identified by x-ray CT for interrupted fatigue tests, particularly at defects characterized as flat or oblate spheroids, no definitive evidence of the emergence of a fatal crack from a single defect was observed. This contrasts with the fatigue behavior of as-built AM AlSi10Mg alloy, where porosity-dominated fatigue crack initiation and the size and type of defects can be correlated with fatigue lifetimes.',\n",

No published studies on the epidemiology of DED have been found in grasslands. We estimated DED prevalence among older adults living in grasslands of northern China and investigated its associated factors and impact on vision-related quality of life (VR-QoL).Methods: A multistage cluster random sampling technique was used to select Mongolian and Han participants aged over 40 from November 2020 to May 2021 in this area. An assessment of DED was performed with Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer's I test (ST), and Tear film break up time (TBUT). All the participants completed the Chinese version of National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) assessing VR-QoL.Results: Of the 1,400 enumerated residents, 1,287 were examined. The overall age and gender standardized prevalence of DED was 34.5%, of which, 32.6% of Mongolian and 35.4% of Han had DED. In a multivariate model, statistically significant associations were found with advancing age [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.04], female gender (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68), smoking (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.98), anti-fatigue eye-drop use (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.77), milk product intake (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.77), number of household members (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72-0.88). DED was associated with lower scores on VR-QoL (beta= -0.14, P < 0.01). Similar results were observed when analyses were stratified by ethnicity.Conclusions: The novelty-associated factors for DED in the grasslands area were anti-fatigue eye drop use, milk product intake, and number of household members. DED and its components were associated with VR-QoL. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.\",\n",

       " [\"Recent advances in 3D technology have been accompanied by increasing complaints of visual fatigue. The usual explanation for such fatigue is that accommodation and convergence are mismatched during stereoscopic vision. The aim of this study was to measure fixation distances between lens accommodation and convergence in young subjects while they viewed real objects and 3D video clips. Measurements were made using an original instrument. The 3D video clips were presented to subjects using a liquid crystal shutter glass system. The results showed that when viewing real objects, the diopter values of subjects' accommodation and convergence were similar and changed periodically. This measurement method was thus considered to be appropriate for the measurement of stereoscopic vision. We also investigated lens accommodation and convergence when subjects viewed 3D video clips. Both accommodation and convergence were found to move along with the virtual position of 3D video clips. Therefore, there was little discrepancy between accommodation and convergence during the viewing of 3D images.\",\n",

With their unique properties in terms of open porosity, large surface area and surface curvature, they are considered to have bone mimicking properties and remarkable osteogenic potential. In this study, scaffolds of gyroid unit cells of different sizes consisting of a Ti6Al4V alloy were manufactured additively by electron beam melting (EBM). The scaffolds were analysed by micro-computed tomography (microCT) to determine their morphological characteristics and, subsequently, subjected to mechanical tests to investigate their quasi-static compressive properties and fatigue resistance. All scaffolds showed an average open porosity of 71-81%, with an average pore size of 0.64-1.41 mm, depending on the investigated design. The design with the smallest unit cell shows the highest quasi-elastic gradient (QEG) as well as the highest compressive offset stress and compression strength. Furthermore, the fatigue resistance of all unit cell size (UCS) variations showed promising results. In detail, the smallest unit cells achieved fatigue strength at 106 cycles at 45% of their compressive offset stress, which is comparatively good for additively manufactured porous biomaterials. In summary, it is demonstrated that the mechanical properties can be significantly modified by varying the unit cell size, thus enabling the scaffolds to be specifically tailored to avoid stress shielding and ensure implant safety. Together with the morphological properties of the gyroid unit cells, the fabricated scaffolds represent a promising approach for use as a bone substitute material.',\n",

It was found that horizontally-built (XY) and machined (M) test pieces, which had not been previously studied in the literature, in both stress-relieved (SR) or non-stress-relieved (NSR) conditions show superior fatigue behavior compared to vertically-built (ZX) and conventionally-manufactured SS 316L. The XY, M, and SR (XY-M-SR) test pieces displayed fatigue behavior similar to the XY-M-NSR test pieces, implying that SR does not have a considerable effect on the fatigue behavior of XY and M test pieces. ZX-M-SR test pieces, due to their considerably lower ductility, exhibited significantly larger scatter and a lower fatigue strength compared to ZX-M-NSR samples. Shot-peening (SP) displayed a positive effect on improving the fatigue behavior of the ZX-NSR test pieces due to a compressive stress of 58 MPa induced on the surface of the test pieces. Fractography of the tensile and fatigue test pieces revealed a deeper understanding of the relationships between the process parameters, microstructure, and mechanical properties for SS 316L produced by laser systems. For example, fish-eye fracture pattern or spherical stair features were not previously observed or explained for cyclically-loaded SLM-printed parts in the literature. This study provides comprehensive insight into the anisotropy of the static and fatigue properties of SLM-printed parts, as well as the pre- and post-fabrication parameters that can be employed to improve the fatigue behavior of steel alloys manufactured using laser systems.',\n",

LCS offers the advantages of higher directionality, localized microstructural refinement and higher metallurgical bonding between coating and substrate. The current research presents the tribo-mechanical evaluation and characterization of solid lubricant based Ni-WC coatings deposited by LCS on Al-Si piston alloy by varying the concentration of graphite between 5-to-15-weight percentage. The tribological behavior of LCS samples was investigated using a ball-on-plate tribometer. Results indicate that the surface hardness, wear rate and friction coefficient of the Al-Si hypereutectic piston alloy were improved after LCS of graphite based HMMC coatings. The maximum surface hardness of 781Hv was acquired for the Ni-WC coating containing 5 wt% graphite. The friction coefficient of Al-Si under dry sliding conditions was reduced from 0.47 to 0.21. The reduction in the friction coefficient was attributed to the formation of a shearable transfer layer, which prevented delamination and reduced adhesion, abrasion and fatigue cracking.',\n",

Advancement in design and the AM of joint replacement implants has mainly targeted implants for large joint replacement while progress in small joint replacements has been limited. This study describes a method for fabrication of porous biodegradable ceramic templates for use in preparing small joint implants such as the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) finger joint by combining powder-bed binder jetting (PBBJ) AM plus post-process sintering. A proposed PIP template design was selected using finite element analysis (FEA) to predict a suitable design for reliable fixation of the implant to host bone through bone ingrowth while providing necessary mechanical properties to avoid implant fracture during anticipated in vivo functional loading. Calcium polyphosphate (CPP) ceramic powder was selected for fabrication of the porous biodegradable ceramic templates intended to degrade in vivo in time to be replaced by bone while retaining a mature articular cartilage layer anchored to the intended joint bearing surface thereby achieving whole joint regeneration. For the AM build-up, density and mechanical strength of porous AM-made samples were optimized by varying the binder saturation level in the PBBJ process. Using the preferred design and processing conditions, PIP joint templates were made and subjected to preliminary fatigue testing to demonstrate survival under anticipated in vivo functional loading conditions. The study has demonstrated the potential of this novel approach for the preparation of implants for use in small digit joint regeneration.',\n",

In this work, we describe a type of prefabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) valves, named the Luer-lock valve, which can be incorporated in 3D printed microfluidic devices utilizing the Luer-lock mechanism. Luer-lock design has been adopted for fluidic connections worldwide; it is facile, reliable, and inexpensive. To take advantage of the Luer-lock design, we added valve ports to our 3D printed microfluidic devices; prefabricated PDMS valve modules could be embedded into these valve ports, in a leak-free manner, by screwing tight the Luer-locks. In the experiment, we succeeded in fabricating pneumatic valves with a footprint diameter of 0.8mm and verified the functionality of these valves with a shut-off pressure of 140mbar and a maximal switching frequency of similar to 1Hz. As a demonstration, we show the serial encoding of core-shell hydrogel microfibers using the Luer-lock valves. Since the Luer-lock valves can be mass-produced and the CAD model of Luer-locks can be easily distributed, we believe that our approach has the potential to be easily adopted by researchers around the globe.',\n",

The influence of scan speed on the densification response, microstructural evolution, Vickers micro-hardness and fretting wear performance of LPBF-ed B4C/Ti composite parts has been evaluated. It revealed that the densification level of composite part was generally reduced as successively increased the scan speed from 600 mm/s to 1800 mm/s, while the microstructure was inversely refined with an initial enhancement of 459.3 HV0.2 and a subsequent reduction of 361.2 HV0.2. As an appropriate scan speed of 1000 mm/s was used, the composite part exhibited a relatively low friction coefficient of 0.23, and was predominated by the fatigue wear mechanism with a low wear rate of 0.85 x 10(-13) m(3)/m, due to its high densification level and refined strengthen effects of hybrid reinforcements. However, as the scan speed increased to 1800 mm/s, the friction coefficient was measured with apparent fluctuations throughout the sliding process, and the abrasive wear accompanied with a severely adhesive wear was dominated with a high wear rate of 6.88 x 10(-13) m(3)/m, ascribing to its further low densification level and Vickers micro-hardness.',\n",

This approach provides the ability to design parts with inherent damping that can suppress vibration by 88-95% compared to fully-fused counterparts, and the damping achieved is a product of only 1-4% unfused powder volume. Inherent damping with LPBF has also addressed conventional shortcomings like manufacturing feasibility, high cycle fatigue (HCF) endurance, and a predictive tool that helps optimize damping by configuring unfused powder volumes. Despite the proven capability of the approach, a threshold unfused powder volume for optimizing damping performance and minimizing structural integrity impact has not been identified. The work in this manuscript addresses this gap in the inherent damping with LPBF capability by leveraging damping data from a varied collection of Nickel Alloy 718 and Stainless Steel 316 L specimens and assessing the trend in vibration suppression with respect to unfused powder volume. Results from this study show a trend in the effects of unfused powder volume on inherent damping performance. With the application of regression and probability distribution analyses, a rule-of-thumb comparison between undamped and passively damped systems has allowed for systemic identification of a threshold value for unfused powder volume.',\n",

Sleep disorders are a prominent, but overlooked problem in patients with dry eye disease (DED), characterized by a poor sleep index, short sleep duration, long sleep latency, and poor subjective sleep. DED and sleep disorders are more prevalent in women than men. Moreover, sleep quality in DED is worse than in other eye diseases, including glaucoma, retinal diseases, cataract, and allergic and chronic conjunctivitis. METHODS. We reviewed the literature for studies investigating sleep and health, eyes and sleep, and DED and sleep, in terms of systemic and eye health, especially in women. RESULTS. Two studies reported that approximately half of patients with DED suffer from poor sleep. The severity of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, is correlated strongly with sleep disorders in DED, and the symptoms and signs of DED, especially pain, also are correlated with sleep quality. Sleep disorders are documented in primary Sjogren's syndrome and an association with sleep apnea and depression is suggested. Primary Sjogren's syndrome includes arthritis and other rheumatic disease causing pain and fatigue; however, how sicca contributes to sleep disorders is not known. CONCLUSIONS. Possible explanations for sleep disorders in DED may be depression, pain, and eye exposure at night. Reciprocal effects may be expected and consultation-liaison psychiatry is recommended for the management of sleep disorders in DED. Topical medication and lid heating also may be advantageous for sleep quality in DED.\",\n",

Later, the high cycle fatigue performance was investigated for the material built with these two sets of parameters at horizontal, vertical, and inclined orientation. In this paper, displacement controlled fully reversed (R = -1) bending type fatigue tests at different levels of displacement amplitude were performed on Krouse type miniature specimens. The test results were compared and analyzed by applying the control signal monitoring (CSM) method.

The projection engine can project 300 image slices per one rotation of the screen, so that we can see the continuous real three-dimensional image by residual images to human eyes. For this prototype, we use a 7 inch green projection CRT that is used in projection TVs as a two-dimensional image engine.

Methods A PubMed and Embase literature search was conducted to identify barriers to OAB therapy adherence. Results OAB therapy adherence is associated with improvements in urinary symptoms, and quality of life with reductions in annual costs for OAB-related expenditures. However, adherence rates to behavioral therapies are as low as 32% at 1 year, only 15%-40% of treated patients remain on oral medications at 1 year due to several factors (e.g., inadequate efficacy, tolerability, and cost), and 5%-10% of OAB patients progress to advanced therapies. While some common barriers to therapy adherence are often fixed (e.g., costs, lack of efficacy, time, side effects, treatment fatigue), many are modifiable (e.g., lack of knowledge, poor relationships, negative experiences, poor communication with providers). Patient-centered care may help address some modifiable barriers. Emerging data demonstrate that patient-centered care in the form of treatment navigators improves OAB therapy adherence and progression to advanced therapies in the appropriate patient. Conclusions There are numerous modifiable barriers to OAB therapy adherence.

Rough surfaces, time in HIP and especially oxidised surfaces prior to HIP all aggravated the argon pick-up. Since the influence of the surface argon pick-up on fatigue performance is not yet known, we recommend that critical components should be machined, blasted, ground or polished after HIP.

Both SLM and EBM samples possessed higher strength and better ductility in the vertical orientation than those in the horizontal orientation. The tensile strength of SLM samples was significantly greater than that of EBM samples whereas the ductility was much lower. Due to the pores contained in samples, fatigue strength of both EBM and SLM samples was lower than those of cast and annealed alloys. However, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) significantly increased the fatigue limits of both SLM and EBM samples to above 550 MPa by closing of the pores. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\",\n",

As a result, surface properties of AM products should be modified to increase their strength, anti-wear behaviour, and at the same time to ensure their high corrosion resistance. Surface modification via shot peening is considered suitable for additive manufacturing of medical devices made of 17-4PH stainless steel. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of shot peening pressures (0.3 MPa and 0.6 MPa) and three types of blasting media (CrNi steel shot, nutshell granules and ceramic beads) on the tribological characteristics and corrosion resistance of specimens of DMLS 17-4PH stainless steel. Results demonstrated that shot peening caused steel microstructure refinement and-except for the nutshell shot-peened specimens-induced both martensite (alpha) formation and retained austenite (gamma) reduction. 17-4PH specimens peened with steel and ceramic shots showed the highest increase in surface hardening by approx. similar to 119% (from 247 to 542 HV), which significantly improved their wear resistance. The highest mechanical properties (hardness and wear resistance) and corrosion resistance were obtained for the surfaces modified using the following media: ceramic beads > CrNi steel shot > nutshell granules. Adhesive and fatigue wear were two predominant mechanisms of tribological deterioration. Results demonstrated that the application of shot peening using ceramic beads led to grain size refinement from 22.0 to 14.6 nm and surface roughness reduction, which in turn resulted in higher corrosion resistance of the material. DMLS 17-4PH specimens modified by shot peening using ceramic beads and a pressure of 0.6 MPa exhibited the optimum surface morphology, hardness and microstructure, and thus improved wear and corrosion performance.',\n",

Samples were designed to have 1 of 3 different notch geometries, including V notches with K-t of 2.2 or 3.1, a U notch with K-t of 2.0, and were printed in either vertical or horizontal orientations. Samples were tested with as-printed dimensions and surfaces after heat treatment, but a separate set of SLM samples were printed as plates and machined to final dimensions comporting to the V-notch specimen with K-t = 3.1. High-cycle fatigue testing showed that machined SLM specimens behaved similar to wrought Inconel 718 plate specimens, but testing with as-produced surfaces led to a decrease in fatigue life. The explanation for this difference is based on approximations of linear elastic fracture mechanics solutions for short cracks emanating from notch roots, with intrinsic surface features of SLM materials serving as the cracks. Analysis of the actual notch geometries after SLM fabrication indicates that stress intensity in the presence of these features plays a prominent role in determining number of cycles before fatigue crack initiation and propagation occurs.',\n",

Traditional deterministic fatigue life models calibrated to witness coupon fatigue data are found capable of predicting the trend in median component fatigue performance, motivating deeper analysis with a probabilistic fatigue life model. A weakest link model is formulated that is applicable to heterogeneous stress states and the transition in failure mode that occurs in Ti-6Al-4V. After calibrating to the witness coupon data, the model is found capable of predicting key trends in the reported component data. After a discussion of the predicted variability and uncertainty, the model is utilized to illuminate how variations in crack initiation site density, e.g. build defects, might impact fatigue performance at the coupon and component level. By comparing to additional literature data, a wide range of sensitivity to initiation site density is illustrated, and subsequently explained via an approximate expression of the model that shows a dependence of sensitivity on the nature of the material and its initiation sites, as well as the level of inspection that is performed.',\n",

In this work, we quantify the microstructural evolution and mechanical performance of an additively repaired AA7075-T651 (Al-Zn-Mg-Cu) via the AFS-D process. To evaluate the AFS-D process for repairing high strength aluminum alloys, the AFS-D technique was used to additively fill a linear groove that was machined into an AA7075-T651 plate. After repairing the plate with the AFS-D process, the repaired plate was subjected to standard T6 heat treatment. The results of this study show that the heat-treated AFS-D repair did not exhibit any significant grain growth and demonstrated an increase in the average Vickers hardness in the repair compared with the wrought 7075-T651 control. Tensile and fatigue behavior was investigated for heat-treated repair and compared with the wrought AA7075-T651 control. The heat-treated repair exhibited wrought-like tensile properties for yield stress (YS) and ultimate stress; however, the heat-treated repair had significant scatter in the elongation to failure. Additionally, the mean fatigue behavior of the heat-treated repairs displayed a reduction in cycles to failure compared with the wrought control. Lastly, a microstructure-sensitive fatigue life model was used to elucidate process-structure-property fatigue mechanism relations of the heat-treated repair and wrought AA7075.',\n",

In the present work, tensile tests and fatigue tests of 304 L stainless steel (SS) fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) with various laser power levels were carried out with in-situ monitoring of acoustic emission (AE) and thermal imager (TI). Microstructural characterizations were performed to measure the surface roughness, porosity, and residual stress of as-built SLMed 304 L SS. A fatigue life prediction model considering surface roughness, porosity, and residual stress was established based on experimental data. In addition, direct evidence is offered to show the strong correspondence between the temperature variable of material surface induced by energy dissipation caused by entropy generation during cyclic deformation and the degradation of material properties caused by fatigue micro-damage. This work indeed provides a novel fatigue life prediction model for SLMed 304 L SS, and advances our current understanding of underlying fatigue micro-damage mechanism of additively manufactured materials.',\n",

Therefore, nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels, such as X30CrMoN151, have been developed in recent decades and conventional processing of this steel by casting or powder metallurgy is well understood. However, only very few attempts to process nitrogen-alloyed martensitically hardenable stainless steels containing more than 0.2 mass-% of carbon by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) have been reported so far. In this study, X30CrMoN15-1 steel powder has been produced from quasi nitrogen-free X30CrMo15-1 steel by gas atomization using N-2 as the process gas to introduce nitrogen into the steel. The gas-atomized powder was characterized in terms of nitrogen content, particle size distribution, particle morphology, and flow properties. The powder was then processed by L-PBF under an N2 gas atmosphere, and microstructural investigations were performed on the L-PBF-built samples using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. Additionally, a first impression of the mechanical properties of the L-PBF-built steel in the as-built and quenched and tempered condition was obtained by means of fatigue tests. It was shown that a nitrogen content of 0.16 mass-% could be introduced into the steel during gas atomization. The resulting powder was successfully processed by means of L-PBF, and specimens with a high density were produced. During fatigue testing, a large amount of retained austenite in the as-built condition resulted in a greater damage tolerance of the specimens compared to the heat-treated condition.',\n",

Thus, post-processing is very important. Shot peening can improve the fatigue strength of metallic materials, and novel peening methods, such as cavitation peening and laser peening, have been developed. In the present paper, to demonstrate an improvement of the fatigue strength of AM Ti6Al4V, Ti6Al4V manufactured by direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and electron beam melting (EBM) was treated by cavitation peening, laser peening, and shot peening, then tested by a plane bending fatigue test. To clarify the mechanism of the improvement of the fatigue strength of AM Ti6Al4V, the surface roughness, residual stress, and surface hardness were measured, and the surfaces with and without peening were also observed using a scanning electron microscope. It was revealed that the fatigue strength at N = 10(7) of Ti6Al4V manufactured by DMLS was slightly better than that of Ti6Al4V manufactured by EBM, and the fatigue strength of both the DMLS and EBM specimens was improved by about two times through cavitation peening, compared with the as-built ones.

As observed experimentally, fatigue damage was incubated almost exclusively at a relatively large pore located at or near the specimen surface, or at an incompletely melted powder particle on the surface in some rare cases. Micromechanical simulations were conducted on a series of representative volume elements to probe the micromechanism of fatigue damage incubation. A non-local plastic shear strain range-based fatigue manage parameter was introduced to represent the micronotch plasticity accumulation state under a large deformation gradient region. This microplasticity parameter was found to correlate to the fatigue endurance limit and transition between high cycle and low cycle fatigue regimes quite well. In the high strain amplitude regime (> 0.3%), the spatial distribution extends no or little effect on fatigue damage incubation. The scatter in fatigue life is primarily dominated by small crack growth. In the low strain amplitude regime, the void on the edge of the specimen induced two times higher microplasticity compared to void inside the specimen. Due to the high population of the voids inside the alloy, the fatigue strength is limited by the voids on the surface. The microplasticity threshold is approximately 0.15% which corresponds to the fatigue endurance limit of 30.8 MPa. Micromechanical simulation demonstrated that the microplasticity induced by the unmelted powder particle is significantly lower than that generated by the void in the microplasticity threshold regime. Therefore, there must be an interactive effect between unmelted powder particles and the surround porosity in the alloy that incubated the fatigue damage. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

Unfortunately, the decision not to accept e-learning continues to be a fundamental issue. The current research provided an alternative lens to view a decision to accept and use technology in a developing country landscape. Accordingly, the present study focused on the impact of human and social factors on the decision to accept e-learning. The undergraduate students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) formed the contextual setting. The theoretical framework employed was a modified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Accordingly, a survey questionnaire was used to employ a dataset of 204 and 15 students in April 2015 for quantitative and qualitative data. Overall, the principal findings show that social influence, attitude and perceived usefulness, stress, satisfaction and fatigue are critical to behavioural intention to accept e-learning. Meanwhile, strong correlations between perceived usefulness and social influence; previous e-learning experience and average time spent using e-learning; previous e-learning experience and behavioural intention demonstrate how the human and social factors influence the e-learning acceptance culture. Ultimately, the contribution provided valuable insights on how to speed up the process of adoption, the use and continuance of e-learning by an understanding of human and social factors. Moreover, recognising human, social and cultural components make it possible to improve e-learning experiences of users. The implications suggest that a better integration of human and social factors to e-learning may help reduce forms of e-learning challenges and shed new insights for theory.',\n",

Moreover, the presence of internal stresses, an outer surface with relatively high surface roughness and the presence of remnant porosity all influence the fatigue life of high cyclically loaded components. The majority of investigations on LPBF produced Ti-6Al-4V have focussed on a fatigue life method providing valuable, albeit limited, insight into fatigue failure mechanisms. Near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates are vital for describing fatigue crack initiation mechanisms and how these are influenced by residual stress, a martensitic microstructure and build orientation. This study investigates near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates of LPBF produced Ti-6Al-4V. The study makes use of full-size compact tension specimens for fatigue crack growth rate investigations, the contour method for residual stress measurement, and scanning electron microscopy with electron backscatter diffraction to consider both morphological and crystallographic texture. Results show anisotropic near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates that are dependant on residual stress levels and load-ratios. Fracture is predominantly governed by transgranular quasi-cleavage mechanisms, and the fracture path is directed by the columnar prior beta-grain structure resulting in orientation-dependant crack closure effects. Residual stresses result in crack opening that causes a shift of near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates. An intrinsic AK(th) of similar to 1.6 +/- 0.2 MPa root m and critical K-max of similar to 3 MPa root m is measured that is independent of the stress state but dependant on orientation. It is shown that this anisotropy is linked to morphological texture and to a lesser extent the crystallographic texture of LBPF produced Ti-6Al-4V. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

The effects of the part position and orientation on the static (tensile) properties of the produced parts were assessed by means of the two-way analysis of variance technique. The build angle was found to be the most effective parameter, while the variability ascribable to the effect of part position resulted mainly as physiological.

Nevertheless, a geometric discrepancy between the as-designed and as-built part is a well-known issue that can be critically important for biomedical metallic lattices with pore size and strut thicknesses of a few hundred microns. In practice, any geometric imperfection introduces a degree of uncertainty that can alter the mechanical properties of the as-built lattice. A quantitative relationship between the as-designed geometry and the real geometry is a very useful design tool because it makes possible to predict the final morphology of the lattice by considering the manufacturing errors: a more predictable geometry of the lattice structure means more predictable mechanical properties of the implant. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the as-designed strut thickness and the printed strut thickness for regular cubic cell lattices. The joints between the struts are filleted to reduce the stress concentration and increase fatigue resistance. The size of the unit cell is scaled to find the smallest radius which can be accurately reproduced. Moreover, we also studied the effect of the printing direction on geometrical accuracy.

Methods Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest imaging, SLE-related damage, and disease activity were examined in 110 SLE patients. Presence was noted of abnormal PFTs, pleural disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), pulmonary infarction, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and shrinking lung syndrome (SLS). PROs included the Medical Outcome Short Form-36 Health Survey, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Borg Dyspnea Scale, patient dyspnea and cough. The PPO of interest was the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Relationships amongst PROs, 6MWT, and pulmonary disease were studied. Results Pulmonary disease was present in 62 (56%) of 110 subjects: 54 (49%) abnormal PFT, 13 (12%) pleural disease, 12 (11%) ILD, 11 (10%) SLS and five (5%) PH. Dyspnea was the only PRO found to be significantly associated with pulmonary disease (P=0.0004). Participants with pulmonary disease compared to those without had significantly reduced distance (P=0.00015, 95% CI for mean 39-125m) and predicted distance (P=0.00001, 10%-26%) on 6MWT. Conclusions Pulmonary disease is common in SLE and adversely impacts 6MWT distance and dyspnea without apparent influence on other PROs.

In this work, a fiber optic conjugate stress sensor (FOCSS) architecture able to detect local stiffness changes in host materials has been fabricated by pairing a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor and an extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) optical fiber sensor. Conjugate stress sensing relies on having two strain sensors of significantly different stiffnesses to create a transfer function from sensor strains to host strain as well as host stress (and hence to host material stiffness and stress-strain hysteresis relationship) independent of the external load. In this work, the FBG performs as the stiff sensor. The optical fiber EFPI sensor is fabricated within a 3D printed polymer sleeve and performs as the compliant sensor. To determine this FOCSS architecture's sensitivity to changes in tangent host stiffness, quasi-static monotonic uniaxial tensile tests of steel were performed past the elastic limit. Finite element modeling is conducted to obtain insights into this FOCSS architecture's performance.

The topic has been tackled experimentally, investigating the impact of heat treatment, machining and micro-shot-peening on the fatigue strength with respect to the as built state. The results indicate that heat treatment significantly enhances the fatigue response, probably due to the relaxation of the post-process tensile residual stresses.

For large-scale adoption, an accurate knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of the resulting materials is fundamental, also considering that reliable data are often lacking and dedicated standards are still missing for these AM alloys. In this regard, the aim of the present work is to characterize both the high-cycle-fatigue (HFC) and the low-cycle-fatigue (LCF) behaviour of AM 17-4 PH stainless steel (SS). To better understand the performance of the selected alloy, four series of cylindrical samples were manufactured. Three series were produced via selective laser melting (SLM), better known as laser-based powder bed fusion of metals technology using an EOS M280 machine. The first series was tested in the as-built condition, the second was machined before testing to obtain a better surface finishing, while the third series was post-processed via hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Finally, a fourth series of samples was produced from the wrought 17-4 PH material counterpart, for comparison. The understanding and assessment of the influence of surface finishing on the fatigue behaviour of AM materials are fundamental, considering that in most applications the AM parts may present reticular or lattice structures, internal cavities or complex geometries, which must be set into operation in the as-built conditions, since a surface finishing postprocess is not convenient or not feasible at all. On the other side, a HIP process is often suggested to reduce the internal porosities and, therefore, to improve the resulting mechanical properties. The high-cycle-fatigue limits were obtained with a short staircase approach according to the Dixon statistical method. The maximum number of cycles (run-out) was set equal to 50,00,000. The part of the Wohler diagram relative to finite life was also characterized by means of additional tests at higher stress levels. On the other side, the low-cycle tests allowed to tune the Ramberg-Osgood cyclic curves and the Basquin-Coffin-Manson LCF curves. The results obtained for the four different series of specimens permitted to quantify the reduction of the mechanical performance due to the actual limits of the laser-based powder bed fusion technology (surface quality, internal porosity, different solidification) with respect to traditional manufacturing and could be used to improve design safety and reliability, granting structural integrity of actual applications under elastic and elasto-plastic fatigue loads.',\n",

Compared to other 3-D printing processes such as SLS, this process does not use any kind of high-intensity laser power to build functional parts out of CAD models and, hence, makes the process much simpler, cheaper, and adaptable. Past studies reveal that productivity of the FDM process can be further increased by effectively controlling its process parameters such as layer thickness, part orientation, extrusion temperature, and so on. In this regard, many authors have investigated the optimal parameter settings for improving part strength, surface finish, wear, and fatigue properties of FDM made prototypes. However, warping performance behavior has got very recent attention due to complex heat transfer mechanism involved during this process. Experimental investigations are necessary to understand the deformation behavior of prototypes. In addition, the quantification and optimization of warp deformation along with dimensional error poses a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. Therefore, this work proposes an evolutionary system identification (SI) approach to explicitly quantify the warp deformation and dimensional error based on the four inputs such as line width compensation, extrusion velocity, filling velocity, and layer thickness of FDM prototypes. The two models' performance analysis comprising of error metrics evaluation, cross-validation, and hypothesis tests is performed to validate its robustness. The analysis concluded that the layer thickness and extrusion velocity influence the warp deformation and, while filling velocity and line width compensation, influences the dimensional error the most.\",\n",

Methods. - We retrospectively evaluated the results provided by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization in 110 consecutive patients with PCPC (35 with isolated PCPC, 38 with associated antegrade PBF, 37 with associated retrograde PBF) in whom TCPC was planned. Results. - Eight patients had superior vena cava syndrome; all others suffered from cyanosis and fatigue. Pulmonary artery size could be determined in 54% of patients without additional PBF, in 47% of those with associated retrograde PBF and in 68% of those with associated PBF (p=0.20). Concomitant clinical signs of increased central venous pressure and echocardiographic signs of ventricular dysfunction and/or hypoplastic pulmonary arteries identified four patients in whom TCPC was not low-risk. PAP exceeding 16 mmHg was found in 9% of patients without and 16% of those with associated PBF (p=0.38). The Nakata index was higher in patients with associated antegrade PBF than in those without associated PBF (p=0.004) or in those with associated retrograde PBF (p=0.002). Of the 16 patients who needed concomitant interventional catheterization, 10 had associated retrograde PBF (p<0.05). In 11 patients (nine with and two without additional PBF), TCPC was contraindicated.

A 2.2 times increase in the fatigue life of samples irradiated by electron beams was revealed. The outcomes of scanning and transmission electron microscopic studies suggest the most probable reason for the fracture of steel samples irradiated by a high-intensity electron beam to be microcraters originating on a treated surface and acting as stress risers initiating the propagation of microcracks. The irradiation with a pulsed electron beam causes extremely fast melting of the surface. As a result of the subsequent rapid crystallization, a polycrystalline structure nearly twice as small as an average grain in the untreated steel is formed. Since a surface layer crystallizes rapidly, crystallization cells ranging from 120 to 170 nm develop in the volume of grains. The fatigue testing is shown to be associated with a martensite transformation gamma epsilon in the surface layer. One option to intensify a fatigue life increase of the steel in focus is supposed to be the neutralization of crater-forming on a surface treated by electron beams.',\n",

       " [\"Pavement is the main structure of road engineering, which consists of multiple structural and functional layers. During the service period, pavement should simultaneously meet the requirements of durability, driving safety and comfort under the combined effects of vehicle load, water and environment temperature. Normally, the design lives for asphalt pavement and concrete pavement are 12-15 and 20-30 years separately. The concept of perpetual pavement had been proposed in recent twenty years, which requires that pavement can resist structural fatigue distress for a long time (at least 50 years). Therefore, the service life and performance of the present asphalt pavement is far from meeting the requirements of perpetual pavement. The reason is not only the raw material and construction quality issues, but also that the existing design theory and design index cannot meet the needs of perpetual pavement design. In addition, the integrating design principles of material-structure-construction had also not been effectively implemented during the pavement design and construction. At present, as to the short design life, the requirements of mechanical properties and fatigue lives of existing pavement materials within the effect of repeated loading can be easily qualified. In order to achieve the perpetual pavement's design life, a new theoretical framework of pavement design may provide the potential solution. Therefore, in this study, the concept of the functionally graded composite pavement was proposed based on the definition of functionally graded materials, which consisted of structural layers with various stiffness. The functionally graded composite pavement could be realized by eliminating the weak adhesion between layers and optimizing the structural response of pavement. Firstly, the types and mechanisms of asphalt pavement cracking were analyzed based on the structural damage characteristics and developments of asphalt pavement, and the effects of the pavement material composition characteristics and the layered structural interfacial state on the cracking mechanisms were then clarified. Secondly, different from the popular elastic layered theory of asphalt pavement, the design theory and design method of the functionally graded composite pavement were proposed. The structural combination and design process of the functionally graded composite pavement were also recommended. Then the technical solutions, which include the development of high-performance functional composite materials and the good layered treatment to eliminate the interface effects, were proposed in order to realize the functionally graded composite pavement. Finally. bridge deck pavements on field concrete bridge and steel bridge were introduced to be as the case study of the functionally graded composite pavement. By employing new pavement materials and improving the interfacial mechanical behaviors. the functionally graded composite pavement on the concrete and steel bridge deck performs well in the service life. When comes to the future of the functionally graded composite pavement, as to the development and widely application of 3D printing technology, the functionally graded pavement with multiple functional, interfaceless and continuous stiffness graded layers could be more easily realized. It can be expected that a potential Chinese solution to realize the perpetual pavement could be presented and the service life of the pavement will be prolonged as to the application of the functionally graded pavement.\",\n",

Themes consistent with lung cancer detection process from a patient's perspective include symptom denial, symptom reductionism, and gradual impact on function. Conclusion: Although the number of participants was extremely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of recruitment, this case study suggests a decline in function present prior to being diagnosed with lung cancer. Opportunities exist within the provider and patient interface to promote earlier detection include educating medical providers to ask specific, closed-ended, non-disease related functional questions to ascertain more details and a holistic representation of patients' health. Raising public awareness of lung cancer symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea, is also warranted.\",\n",

       " ['A monolithic silicon integrated optical micro-scanner is presented. The device consists of a mirror located on the tip of a thermal bimorph actuator beam. The fabrication process is very simple and compatible with IC fabrication techniques. The device is excited electrothermally at its resonance frequency, enabling large angular deflections at low power consumption. The technological process consists of basic frontside silicon micromachining steps requiring only three mask levels. The moving part is defined by selective silicon bulk etching. The bimorph beam is made of silicon dioxide and a thin film conductor. The residual stress in the two layers is used to achieve a 45 degrees out-of-plane rest position of the mirror. This allows optical components (e.g., laser diode, collimating lens) to be placed directly on the silicon substrate. Mirrors of 500 x 300 to 800 x 800 mu m(2) with resonant frequencies varying from 600 to 100 Hz were realized. Mechanical scan angles of above 90 degrees were achieved. The devices are very robust and have run through fatigue tests of billions of cycles at 300 Hz and 90 degrees deflection. The power consumption of the device is typically 1 mW for 30 degrees mirror deflection. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.',\n",

However, a limited number of studies describe the fatigue properties of HEAs. Most of them focused on the two systems of CoCrFeMnNi or AlCoCrFeNi produced by arc or induction meltings. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of CrFeCoNi medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) produced by additive manufacturing was investigated to extend the understanding of the HEA applications. The fatigue test is conducted at a frequency of 25 Hz, and the stress ratio of 0.1. The changes in fatigue and tensile properties are studied through structural and phase analysis. Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the impact of machining and heat treatment on the fatigue characteristics of the MEA samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

Root cause analysis procedures are used to identify the failure modes discovering typical performance limits of hydraulic fluids and fluid power components. Therefore, pump lubrication and operation requirements, preferably existing in pump manufacturer specifications, must be determined. Hydraulic fluid performance standards are developed in International Standards ISO 11158, Specifications for mineral. oils hydraulic fluids (H), ISO 12922, Specifications for fire-resistant fluids (HF) and ISO/DIS 15380 Specifications for environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids (I-IE). All these standards represent minimum requirements. Fire-resistant and environmentally acceptable fluids show the most different performances in comparison to mineral oil based fluids. Fluid and components properties should be in good balance. The performance of different hydraulic fluids and various pumps has been predicted using small - and large - scale bench tests, Performance limits on fluids and pumps were finally tested together, followed by root cause analysis to identify hydraulic failure modes. Finally, fluid additives or component modifications led to high system performances and optimized fluid power applications. This paper describes important failure modes, reasons for fluid-depending material damages and rolling contact fatigue failures in roller bearings for hydraulic systems which are significant fur the components life span. The report is focused on both useful fluid and appropriate pumps. Results from hydraulic pump tests with new steel quality for roller bearings are useful for optimized tribological systems, aqueous or non aqueous hydraulic fluids and new applications in fluid power industries.',\n",

The introduction of fluorinated polymer chains greatly enhances the mechanical strength, extends the durability of the LCNs, and results in the rapid, accurate and lasting NIR-controlled transportation of liquidviathe model pump. Amazingly, if the NIR light source is fixed to cycle on for 15 s and off for 20 s automatically, the as-prepared NIR-controlled pump can transport 0.5 mL of liquid each cycle (35 s) and work uninterruptedly for more than 1.0 h without any manually assisted operation.',\n",

To investigate effects of initial microstructure, the material was deposited in two directions. As a result, the axial loading direction was 45 and 90 with respect to the deposition direction. To further investigate effects of initial microstructure, a few samples of the printed material underwent hot isostatic pressing (HIP). As-printed samples as well as the HIP processed samples were further heat treated (HT) according to AMS 5663 after machining the LCF specimens. To have a reference for the LCF behavior of DMLS Inconel 718, a set of wrought Inconel 718 samples in the same HT condition was also made, and the results critically compared against the results for the DMLS materials. Strain controlled LCF tests were conducted under a mean engineering strain of 0.5% and several strain amplitudes ranging from 0.6% to 1.4%. LCF behavior of DMLS HT material was found to be better than that of wrought HT material at lower strain amplitudes. However, the wrought material had longer life at higher strain amplitudes. The results revealed that the role of porosity present in the DMLS specimens is not as significant at low strain amplitudes as it is at high strain amplitudes. Furthermore, we found that the HIP treatment deteriorated the LCF performance of the material, suggesting that a high content of annealing twins present in the HIPed material microstructure has a larger effect on shortening the life of the samples than porosity. Finally, the Coffin-Manson model was fit to extract the strain-life curves for the studied materials. At lower strain amplitudes, where plastic strain is small, the standard Coffin-Manson model deviated from the data. A bilinear Coffin-Manson model for LCF was found to better capture the data.

Equaxied gamma-phase together with the inside {111} < 112 > type twin and platelet epsilon-phase was found in both the Cu-bearing and Cu-free alloys. Compared to the Cu-free alloy, the introduction of 3 wt.% Cu significantly increased the volume fraction of the epsilon-phase. In both alloys, the hardness of epsilon-phase zone was rather higher (similar to 4 times) than that of gamma-phase zone. The wear factor of 3 wt.% Cu-bearing alloy possessed smaller wear factor, although it had higher friction coefficient compared with Cu-free alloys. The epsilon-phase in the CoCr alloy would account for reducing both abrasive and fatigue wear. Moreover, the Cu-bearing alloy presented relatively higher corrosion potential E-corr and lower corrosion current density I-corr compared to the Cu-free alloy. Accordingly, 3 wt.% Cu addition plays a key role in enhancing the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of CoCrW alloys, which indicates that the SLM CoCrW-3Cu alloy is a promising personalized alternative for traditional biomedical implant materials.',\n",

In the process, the cast roll sleeve material considerably influences the temperature field. The numerical simulation of SLS-TRC is performed to analyze the effects of cast roll sleeve material on molten pool temperature field, roll surface temperature, and clad strip temperature at different casting speeds. The sandwich composite plate was manufactured on the vertical twin-roll casting mill on the basis of the simulation results, and the composite plate was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, the thermal resistance model of the heat transfer from the molten pool to the cast roll in SLS-TRC was proposed. When the cast roll sleeve material changed from steel to copper, the KISS point, which is the dividing point between the casting stage and the rolling stage, increases by 5 to 10 mm, and the outlet temperature decreases by 134 degrees C. If the KISS point maintains the same height, the casting speed can increase by 0.3 to 0.6 m/min. The increase of casting speed results in the increase of copper roll surface temperature that is considerably less than that of steel roll surface temperature. This scenario helps improve the thermal fatigue service conditions of the cast roll. SEM analysis indicates that when the cast roll sleeve material is copper, the core grain size increases with the increase of casting speed. However, it decreases when the sleeve is steel. The thermal resistance model shows that when the sleeve material changes from steel to copper, the heat transfer thermal resistance is reduced, thereby increasing the melt solidification rate. This scenario helps increase the casting speed, thereby improving the manufacturing efficiency.',\n",

So far, however, short gastric residence times and safety considerations have limited their use. To mitigate such limitations, in this work expandable fibrous dosage forms were investigated for mechanical strength and gastric residence time in dogs. The fiber formulation comprised ibuprofen drug; water-absorbing, high-molecular-weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) excipient; fiber-strengthening, enteric methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate excipient; and barium sulfate, a gastrointestinal contrast agent. The fibers were coated either with a hydrophilic sugar, or with a strengthening enteric excipient. Upon administration to a dog, in the stomach the dosage form with sugar-coated fibers expanded to 1.7 times its initial radius in 50-100 minutes, and disintegrated after 4.8 hours. The dosage form with the enteric-excipient-coated fibers, by contrast, expanded to 1.6 times the initial radius in 5 hours, and fractured after 31 hours due to cyclic loads applied by the contracting stomach walls. The fragments passed into the small intestine where they dissolved in less than 2-3 hours. Diametral compression tests and dynamic fatigue failure models show that the substantial increase in gastric residence time is due to strengthening of the fibers by the enteric-excipient coating. Because the enteric excipient is a rubbery semi-solid in the acidic gastric fluid and dissolves in the pH-neutral intestinal fluids, safety concerns should be minimal. Thus, expandable fibrous dosage forms can be readily designed for prolonged, safe gastric retention.',\n",

The micro-architecture of the porous biomaterials and, thus, their physical properties could then be precisely controlled. Due to their many favorable properties, porous biomaterials manufactured using AM are considered as promising candidates for bone substitution as well as for several other applications in orthopedic surgery. The mechanical properties of such porous structures including static and fatigue properties are shown to be strongly dependent on the type of the repeating unit cell based on which the porous biomaterial is built. In this paper, we study the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials made from a relatively new unit cell, namely truncated cube. We present analytical solutions that relate the dimensions of the repeating unit cell to the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling load of those porous structures. We also performed finite element modeling to predict the mechanical properties of the porous structures. The analytical solution and computational results were found to be in agreement with each other. The mechanical properties estimated using both the analytical and computational techniques were somewhat higher than the experimental data reported in one of our recent studies on selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V porous biomaterials. In addition to porosity, the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the porous structures were found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the length of the inclined struts to that of the uninclined (i.e. vertical or horizontal) struts, a, in the truncated cube unit cell. The geometry of the truncated cube unit cell approaches the octahedral and cube unit cells when a respectively approaches zero and infinity. Consistent with those geometrical observations, the analytical solutions presented in this study approached those of the octahedral and cube unit cells when a approached respectively 0 and infinity.

Nevertheless, the widespread industrial use of titanium is greatly hindered by its high extraction and manufacturing costs with respect to other metallic counterparts such as steel and aluminium. The scientific community has devoted a great effort in understanding and developing more efficient processing methods for titanium. Most of these methods are powder-based (i.e. powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing) due to the intrinsic advantages that their use brings about such as high material yield, limited machining operations, and a high degree of freedom on alloy composition and structural complexity. Properties like fatigue and fracture toughness, especially of materials manufactured using new non-conventional metallurgical processing routes, are critical parameters for materials selection and structural design optimisation. Nonetheless, these properties have been highly disregarded in comparison to static properties (i.e. tensile behaviour) due to their more complex nature. This paper presents a systematic and critical analysis of the current scientific knowledge about fatigue and fracture properties of titanium alloys manufactured via powder-based methods. This review clarifies the effect that microstructural features inherent to each specific method, such as porosity and phases, have on the fatigue and fracture behaviours. The review demonstrates that, through appropriate manufacturing technology and parameters selection, titanium alloys with similar or improved properties can be achieved by means of more cost-effective powder-based processes rather than via ingot metallurgy.',\n",

For most cages, the stiffness of the cage is high enough to cause stress concentration, leading to a stress shielding effect between the vertebral bones and the cages. The stress shielding effect affects the outcome after the reconstruction surgery, easily causing damage and leading to a higher risk of reoperation. A porous structure for the spinal fusion cage can effectively reduce the stiffness to obtain more comparative strength for the surrounding tissue. In this study, an intervertebral cage with a porous gradation structure was designed for Ti64ELI alloy powders bonded by the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The medical imaging software InVesalius and 3D surface reconstruction software Geomagic Studio 12 (Raindrop Geomagic Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA) were utilized to establish the vertebra model, and ANSYS Workbench 16 (Ansys Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA) simulation software was used to simulate the stress and strain of the motions including vertical body-weighted compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation. The intervertebral cage with a hollow cylinder had porosity values of 80-70-60-70-80% (from center to both top side and bottom side) and had porosity values of 60-70-80 (from outside to inside). In addition, according to the contact areas between the vertebras and cages, the shape of the cages can be custom-designed. The cages underwent fatigue tests by following ASTM F2077-17. Then, mechanical property simulations of the cages were conducted for a comparison with the commercially available cages from three companies: Zimmer (Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA), Ulrich (Germany), and B.

Additional analysis of the hardness and scanning electron microscopy was carried out to complement the discussion of the results. The obtained dada showed that the stress relieved specimens exhibits significantly cyclic softening, increasing with applied strain, while HIP specimens show a practically stable cyclic behavior in relation to the monotonic curve. Material response for both treatments is well fitted by Basquin and Coffm-Manson formulations.

The microstructural results reveal that the cellular substructure plays a decisive role in regulating the dislocation motion during cyclic deformation, resulting in the intergranular fatigue cracking along HAGBs rather than twin boundaries.',\n",

Such materials have great benefits over common MEMs materials such as better fracture toughness and fatigue properties than semiconductors, and higher stiffness to weight ratios than most metals. Composite structures yield remarkable improvements in microrobotic links and joints, as well as greater performance actuators while allowing complicated microrobotic mechanisms to be easily rapid prototyped.

In order to design reliable AMparts, the mechanical properties resulting from the manufacturing process need to be understood. The present study investigates the fatigue of AM Ti-6Al-4V and 316L. Miniaturized Ti-6Al-4V and 316L specimens were manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). The geometry, process parameters, and loading conditions were kept constant and the specimens were tested in as-built surface condition. The S-N curves of as-built, stress-relieved and HIP'ed specimens were measured, and an analysis of themicrostructure, relative density and surface roughness was performed. The effect of fatigue influencing factors (residual stresses, surface roughness, porosity and microstructure) was systematically investigated. In order to understand the fatigue failure mechanism, identification of crack initiation point, via fracture surfaces analysis, was performed.\",\n",

This technology belongs to additive manufacturing or 3D printing technologies and allows produce metal parts with complicated shapes in short production time and without the need to use expensive molds or large material waste. As the SLM technology is still under intensive research, the production process is not optimized for wide range of materials (most of studies were focused on titanium or aluminum alloys). Low quality of SLM materials is mainly connected with production defects caused by big temperature gradients during production. The SLM material is subjected to fatigue bending tests, which are supplemented by acoustic emission (AE) measurement and fractography analysis. By AE is possible to analyze fatigue behavior in detail and determine different fatigue stages and mechanism of crack propagation. After verification experiments, it is also possible to predict the remaining fatigue life. All results are compared with fatigue properties of conventionally produced Cu alloy AMPCOLOY (R) 944 (Cu7Ni2Si1Cr) using standard S-N curves. The fatigue life of SLM material is slightly worse than we can observe in conventionally produced materials and AE results suggest that there is different mechanism of crack propagation. As expected, the fractography study shows there is big amount of production defects (mainly pores) in SLM material and the crack origins are located near them.',\n",

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, case-control study and outpatients aged 10 to 19y were recruited from six eye clinics of various practices and locations in Japan, and 253 non-DED subjects and 70 DED patients were enrolled. Participants were examined for DED-related signs. Patients were also interviewed to ascertain the presence or absence of six common DED-related symptoms: dryness, irritation, pain, eye fatigue, blurring, and photophobia. Main outcome measures were differences in signs and symptoms of dry eye disease between boys and girls. RESULTS: Of the 323 adolescents recruited, 70 (21.7%) were diagnosed with DED. Significant differences between the non-DED and DED groups were found for short tear break-up time (BUT; <= 5s; P=0.000) and superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK; staining score >= 3; P=0.000). Late adolescent girls reported fewer symptoms than late adolescent boys, although their DED-related signs were worse compared to other groups. The prevalence and severity of DED were similar in the Tokyo area compared with suburban and local areas but myopic errors were worse. CONCLUSION: We find that adolescents reported symptoms of DED similar to those found in adults, and the majority have short BUT-type DED. The prevalence and severity of DED in late adolescent girls is comparable with adults. Adolescents with DED are underserved and we believe that DED is a hidden but potentially serious health problem for this age group.',\n",

The motion of the device is in-plane with the excitation vibrations, and this is enabled through the exploitation of a leaf isosceles trapezoidal flexural pivot topology. This topology is ideally suited for systems requiring restricted out-of-plane motion and benefits from being fabricated monolithically. This is achieved by 3D printing the topology with materials having a low flexural modulus. The presented system has a nonlinear softening spring response, as a result of designed magnetic force interactions. A discussion of fatigue performance is presented and it is suggested that whilst fabricating, the raster of the suspension element is printed perpendicular to the flexural direction and that the experienced stress is as low as possible during operation, to ensure longevity. A demonstrated power of similar to 25 mu W at 0.1 g is achieved and 2.9 mW is demonstrated at 1 g. The corresponding bandwidths reach up-to 4.5 Hz. The system's corresponding power density of similar to 0.48 mW cm(-3) and normalised power integral density of 11.9 kg m(-3) (at 1 g) are comparable to other in-plane systems found in the literature.\",\n",

AM is a disruptive technology that is rapidly growing, owing to its effective features: high accuracy, fast production, and low cost. Parts made of polylactic acid (PLA) biodegradable material fused deposition modeling are being increasingly produced in the industry because of their high strength and environment-friendliness. Three-dimensionally printed parts are prone to different loading types (static, dynamic, and time-dependent loading) during in-service operations. They react differently to loadings based on their manufacturing process parameters and geometry. This research aims to study the influence of notch and mean stress on the uniaxial fatigue behavior of PLA parts. The fatigue tests were load-controlled and performed with fatigue load ratios, R = -1, 0.1, and 0.3, on three rectangular-shaped specimens with large, medium, and sharp notches. The study was conducted with 180 fatigue tests and mainly focused on the high cycle fatigue regime. The experimental results showed that the effect of notches and mean stresses were significant on the PLA fatigue life. The Kohout and Vechet model, along with the factor of stress triaxiality, was used in order to study the notch influence on PLA fatigue life. Moreover, Walker model was used to investigate the influence of mean stress on PLA fatigue life. The life prediction of the two models accurately agreed with the experimental results.

These defects are further found to influence fatigue behaviour, which is analysed using a Murakami area model. Finally, the ultrasonic fatigue test results are interpreted in the context of applied stress intensity factor and an optimized fatigue limit fit. Two different kinds of physical behaviour, representing Murakami dependence and a long crack regime, are found to better correlate the fatigue life behaviour than the Murakami model alone.

Although the mechanical properties of additively manufactured metals, such as the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, are well-established, a complete understanding of the fatigue performance is still a pending aspiration due to its inherent stochastic complexity and the influence of several manufacturing factors. This paper presents a study of the influence of speed manufacturing and porosity in the fatigue behaviour of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy. To this aim, a numerical simulation of the expected porosity at different laser velocities is performed, together with a simulation of the residual stresses. These numerical results are compared with experimental measurements of residual stresses and a qualitative analysis of the porosities. Then, fatigue strength is experimentally obtained for two different laser speeds and fitted by a probabilistic model. As a result, the probabilistic S-N fields for different laser velocities are found to be similar, with scatter bands nearly coincident, drawing the conclusion that this effect is negligible in comparison with other concurrent ones, such as roughness or surface defects from manufacturing conditions, promoting crack initiation and premature fatigue failure.',\n",

This article attempts to address this gap through a phenomenological study examining activist burnout in racial justice activists of color whose primary sites of activism are predominantly white colleges and universities in the United States at which they work. In order to stretch activist burnout theory to differentiate unique marginalized-identity activists' burnout causes from general causes that do not consider specific activist identities, the lens of racial battle fatigue is employed. Findings show that, although participants shared many causes of burnout that are consistent with general non-identity-specific causes described in existing literature, racial battle fatigue hastened their burnout while their activist commitments elevated their battle fatigue.\",\n",

This paper presents a fatigue study in specimens of two base materials used in mould production (AISI H13 and P20). Filler material as well as welding parameters were analysed in order to obtain better fatigue strength. The tests were carried out under constant amplitude loading, with two stress ratios R = 0 and R = 0.4. Welded specimens were prepared with V notches and filled with laser welding deposits. The fatigue results are presented in the form of S-N curves obtained in welded and non-welded conditions. Complementary measurements of hardness profiles and SEM analysis were carried out to understanding the fatigue behaviour and failure sites. The laser-deposit material was the weaker region in both steels, due to a high level of tensile residual stresses and also to some planar defects that are potential failure sites. Fatigue crack initiation is therefore reduced and the fatigue propagation life is enhanced. A significant mean stress effect in the base material was also observed in both mould steels.

Performance motorcycles, while boasting extremely light suspension components and competition-ready performance, have an inherent weakness in comfort, as the suspension systems are designed primarily for racing purposes. Front suspension acceleration and shock loading transmit directly through the front suspension triple clamp into the rider's arms and shoulders, causing rapid fatigue in shoulder muscles. Magneto-rheological fluid dampers and skyhook control systems offer an alternative to conventional sport motorcycle suspensions - both performance and comfort can be combined in the same package. Prototype MRF dampers designed and manufactured specifically for this application require no more space than conventional twin tube designs while adding only 1.7 pounds total weight to the system. The MRF dampers were designed for high controllability and low power consumption, two vital considerations for a motorcycle application. The tests conducted include the dampers' force-velocity curve testing in a damper test rig and suspension performance based on damper position, velocity, and acceleration measurement. Damper test rig results show the MRF dampers have a far greater range of adjustability than the test vehicle's OEM dampers. Combined with a modified sky-hook control system, the MRF dampers can greatly decrease the acceleration and shock loading transmitted to the rider through the handlebars while contributing performance in manners such as anti-dive under braking. Triple clamp acceleration measurements from a variety of staged road conditions, such as sinusoidal wave inputs, will be compared to subjective test-rider field reports to establish a correlation between rider fatigue and the front suspension performance. This testing will be conducted on the OEM vehicle suspension, the passive MRF dampers, and the skyhook-controlled MRF damper front suspension. The results of this test will determine the viability of skyhook-controlled MRF damper systems on motorcycles for performance gain and fatigue reduction.\",\n",

Ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) can induce compressive residual stress by generating severe plastic deformation of the material surface, and improve the wear resistance through surface texture refinement. In the present study, we investigated the changes in the metallurgical and mechanical properties of DEDed M4 specimens as induced by UNSM treatment. An X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the DEDed M4 austenite was transformed into martensite after UNSM processing. The change in the full width at half maximum revealed a grain size decrease of 25.8%. Conversion of the tensile residual stress within the DEDed M4 to compressive residual stress through UNSM treatment was confirmed. These changes in the metallurgical characteristics yield a 24.1% increase in the DEDed M4 hardness. A wear test was conducted to evaluate the wear resistances of heat-treated D2, DEDed M4 on D2, and UNSM-DEDed specimens. Ball -on-disk wear tests revealed that the DEDed M4 specimen wear rate was 68.3% lower than that of the H-D2. In addition, the DEDed M4 wear rate was reduced by 85.7% through UNSM treatment. The surface roughness was reduced by up to 88.3%, while micro-dimple shapes were formed on the DED-treated M4 surface. This study has demonstrated that UNSM can be applied to a DED-treated M4 surface to enhance its metallic and mechanical properties.',\n",

Stress controlled fatigue tests were conducted at different stress amplitudes for samples in the horizontal direction (HD) and vertical direction (VD). The fatigue strength of as-built samples after sustaining 2x10(6) cycles were 135 MPa and 128 MPa for VD and HD specimens, respectively. Fatigue strength was less for both the samples in different orientation than the wrought counterpart (similar to 40%). The increase in tensile strength and decrease in fatigue strength is attributed to the presence of austenitic columnar grains with a smaller ferrite fraction less than 5% and noticed phase transformation along with local recrystallization as a result of remelting the former layers along the BD during deposition. The higher kernel average misorientation values confirm the degree of grain misorientation along the BD.

The phases, size and shape of melt pool, volume and distribution of defects are analyzed and correlated to the compressive mechanical and fatigue properties. Due to different powder bed temperatures, the microstructure of EBM and SLM samples consists of alpha+beta phases and a single phase, respectively. The faster cooling rate during SLM promotes the formation of fine beta dendrites, which leads to a higher compressive strength (50 +/- 0.9 MPa) and lower Young's Modulus (0.95 +/- 0.05 GPa) in comparison to the EBM parts (45 +/- 1.1 MPa and 1.34 +/- 0.04 GPa respectively). The large defects present within solid strut are likely a result of tin vaporization. The tin vapor is more easily trapped during the SLM process due to a smaller laser spot size and a faster cooling rate. This results in a 10 times increase in the number of defects. These defects have a limited influence on both the static properties and low stresses level fatigue strength, but it causes a reduced and variable fatigue life at high stresses level.

This study aims to explore the validity of that claim by examining the characteristics of the robberies through the lens of online news coverage. Design/methodology/approach - Google, Bing and main online NZ news outlets were searched for news reports between 2009 and 2018 of tobacco-related store robberies. Content analysis was used to extract characteristics such as date of robbery, type of store, items targeted or stolen and demographic profile of offenders. The prevalence of reported robberies by socioeconomic level of the surrounding community was assessed using nearest primary school decile rating. Descriptive statistics and statistical analysis were used to discuss trends and key findings in the data. Findings - Reports on 572 robberies were unevenly distributed across the years with a large increase in 2016 and 2017, followed by a substantial decrease in 2018. Local community convenience stores were primarily hit - more so in lower socioeconomic communities. Robberies occurred nationwide and disproportionately so during colder months in lower socioeconomic communities. Many robberies were aggravated resulting in serious injury to shopkeepers. Tobacco and cash were predominantly targeted. Social implications - The large increase in robberies that occurred in 2016-2017 likely resulted from tax-driven tobacco price hikes combined with reduced duty-free tobacco coming into NZ with travellers. Installation of security in stores, news fatigue and oilier explanations are potential reasons for the 2018 decrease in reported robberies despite tobacco prices increasing. Frequent robberies of local stores, many including violence, should be a public health concern as destruction of community well-being can be a determinant of other health problems. The negative consequences for communities, particularly lower socioeconomic communities, need to be factored into the cost benefit analysis of raising the tax on tobacco. Originality/value - This study provides much needed detail on the negative health and social consequences of tobacco-related store robberies.',\n",

The intrinsic process-induced defects, particularly microporosity and lack of fusion, as well as their size and relative orientation with respect to the building direction, affect the fatigue performance of the SLM-processed components. Herein, the influence of building direction and defect sensitivity on the fatigue behavior of SLM-fabricated AISI H13 steel is investigated. Samples are tested after tempering and turning to find a compromise between tensile strength and toughness and minimize the effect of geometrical distortion. The fatigue strength is assessed by employing the Murakami model, and short-crack effect is evaluated by calculating the El Haddad-Smith-Topper length parameter. An inferior fatigue performance of the SLM parts is observed in comparison to that of the conventionally processed materials, owing to the presence of defects that act as origins of crack initiation. The fatigue strength is significantly influenced by the defect size, shape, and the distance from surface, which in turn are affected by the building direction. A slightly higher fatigue resistance is observed for the 90 degrees-oriented samples, owing to the smaller defect size and the lower stress concentration factor. The data for the three building directions show a high scatter, attributed to the process-defect-induced stress concentration factors.',\n",

For laser peening, the specimen was placed in water, and the effect of the impact produced at the target due to collapsing bubbles, which developed after laser ablation of the surface, was greater than the effect due to the laser ablation itself. For cavitation peening, the cavitation was generated by injecting a high speed water jet into water. In each case improvements in the fatigue strength of the Ti6A14V were made. Improvements of 104% by laser peening, 84% by cavitation peening and 68% by shot peening compared with a non-peened specimen were achieved.',\n",

These days, there are tons of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) waste products that are generated around the world. This waste presents a real environmental hazard because PET is not biodegradable. This paper delineates the physical and chemical properties of PET to justify its use as an additive and aggregate replacement in the manufacture of asphalt mixtures. Furthermore, discusses details of PET-modified asphalt mixture by a dry and wet process with sufficient information to better understand the mixture. Several critical matters are investigated, such as asphalt modification to increase resistance to fatigue, rutting deformation, and moisture sensitivity. These results are important for determining the factors that significantly improve pavement mixture characteristics. The findings show that the addition of PET to asphalt mixtures yielded very promising results. PET enhanced the mechanical properties, the durability, and the long-term sustainability of the pavement. Finally, using PET waste as an additive in asphalt mixtures could serve as an environmentally friendly method to dispose of PET waste while simultaneously producing high-quality pavements.',\n",

This in turn, affects the microstructure and consequently, the mechanical behavior of material. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the AM part's thickness and geometry on microstructure, surface roughness, and mechanical properties under quasi-static and fatigue loading conditions by performing experimental tests. A series of Ti-6Al-4V specimens with three different thicknesses and two different geometries were fabricated using electron beam melting (EBM). The results of microstructural analyses revealed that specimens with lower build thickness experience finer grain size, higher microhardness, and lower elongation at failure. Although the microstructure of the produced parts was strongly affected by the build thickness, different surface to volume ratios eliminated the effect of microstructural differences and governed the fatigue properties of the parts. The size effect on the microstructural features, geometrical appearance, mechanical properties of the AM parts should be considered for the design and failure analysis of complex structures.\",\n",

The focus of the analysis is on the changes in microstructures and the mechanical properties caused by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) as post treatment. For that purpose, samples produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) were exposed to hot isostatic pressing post-treatment followed by solution annealing. The properties of this condition were compared to properties of the duplex steels without post-heat treatment and of those of samples with only solution annealing as post-treatment. Both duplex steels had a predominantly ferritic structure after the LPBF process. Subsequent heat treatments were able to establish a ferritic-austenitic duplex structure. HIP applied before solution annealing leads to a coarsening of austenite grains and a reduction in porosity. All post-heat treated samples meet the minimum requirements of the standard DIN EN 10088-3 regarding tensile properties. An effect of hot isostatic pressing was seen in the fatigue strength. An increase in the fatigue strength was measured in both steels, which was mainly attributed to the decrease in inner defects size.',\n",

The stainless steel AISI 316L/1.4404 was used as model alloy for lattice structures that exhibited a relative density of 33% compared to bulk samples and a part density of 2.623 g/cm(3). Using optical microscopy, SEM, EDS, DIC analyses as well as tension, compression and fatigue testing, microstructures and mechanical properties of the two types of lattice structures were compared with annealed counterparts, SLM-produced bulk and reference specimens of the same chemical composition. It was found that the f2cc,z lattice structures deformed by stretch, whereas the hollow spherical lattice structures presented a bending dominated deformation mode. Consequently, f2cc,z lattice specimens revealed higher energy absorption capacity and were capable of bearing higher loads. In addition, the f2cc,z samples showed comparable specific energy absorption with respect to bulk reference samples. The plastic deformation behavior of the different lattice structures has been assessed by considering geometrical and microstructural aspects.

Design/methodology/approach - Because the TangoBlackPlus material is marketed as rubber-like, the printed elastomer specimens were tested according to the ASTM D4482-11 Test Method for Rubber Property Extension Cycling Fatigue. The microstructure of the printed material and multi-material interface was examined by slicing specimens and examining them under an optical microscope. Findings - Findings are developed to show the relationship between elongation and expected fatigue life. Findings also indicate that the smoother, non-support encased glossy surface finish option for PolyJet parts improve the fatigue life of components and that there are a number of microscopic voids in the TangoBlackPlus material that seem to be concentrated at layer and print head boundaries. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides a glimpse into the fatigue properties and microstructure of printed elastomeric parts, a previously unstudied area. This work is limited in that it only looks at specimens created in a single orientation, on a single machine, with a single material. More work is needed to understand the general fatigue properties of printed elastomers and the factors that influence fatigue life in these materials. Practical implications - The authors provide several design guidelines based on the findings and previous work that can be used to increase the fatigue life of printed elastomer components. Originality/value - As additive manufacturing (AM) technology moves from a prototyping tool to a tool used to create end use products, it is important to examine the expected lifespan of AM components.

Therefore, different fabric penetrations (pins) have been created which vary in length. These penetrative interfaces have been studied in quasi-static tensile (shear) tests and fatigue tests. Deformation and damage processes were determined during tensile and fatigue loading by measurement of the local strain distribution, utilizing a 3D-digital image correlation (DIC) system. Additionally, light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) investigations were carried out in order to assess the damage mechanisms and fracture surfaces. The quasi-static tests revealed that tensile shear strength increased by 503 % compared to solely adhesive interface, due to the integration of long pins. Furthermore, different pin-size-depending failure mechanisms have been detected.

Investigations have been made for very high cycle fatigue as well as fatigue crack growth. To understand the fatigue phenomenon, characterization of basic material properties is also carried out. Results show that the material defects as well as microstructure is influenced by these parameters. The corresponding fatigue and crack growth behavior is improved by base plate heating which changes the fatigue crack initiation mechanisms as well.

A CoCrFeMnNi HEA manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) had a heterogeneous grain structure and dislocation network-induced sub-structures. Furthermore, nanosized oxides dispersed at the sub-structure and grain boundaries of SLM-built HEA. The results of tensile tests indicated that this SLM-built HEA had superior yield strength of 774.8 MPa with an elongation of 30.8%. The S-N curves revealed that the resistance of the SLM-built HEA to HCF was extraordinarily high compared with that of a homogenized (conventional casting + hot rolling + heat treatment) HEA. The corresponding fatigue limits of the SLM-built and homogenized HEAs were 570 MPa and 280 MPa, respectively. The excellent fatigue resistance of the SLM-built HEA is attributed to its unique microstructural characteristics (i.e., heterogeneous grain structures, dislocation networks, and in-situ formed oxides), and the deformation twins generated during cyclic load. The un-melted powder generated during the additive manufacturing (AM) process also contributed to the HCF resistance of the SLM-built HEA. Based on these findings, the correlations among the unique microstructure, internal defects, HCF properties, and fatigue fracture mechanism of the SLM-built HEA are also discussed.',\n",

Robotics has the potential to improve work efficiency, reduce production cost, protect humans from adverse conditions, and increase production scale. A three-dimensional (3D) printed amphibious spherical robot was designed to operate in various environments with a wide-range of complex conditions over a long period of time. The compact, fully waterproof design has the advantages of a reduced manufacturing time, high efficiency, good mobility, low noise, and reliable stability. This study considers how some of the more critical components of the robot, such as its leg brackets, circular middle plate, and spherical shell, respond to large dynamic stresses, shocks, and vibrations during operation; this can lead to reduced precision of the robot's locomotion and may cause critical components to become damaged or fail. To design the robot with a more rigid structure and improved dynamic characteristics, 3D models of the critical components were constructed with SolidWorks. Using ANSYS WORKBENCH software, these models were incorporated into the robot design to determine the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of the first six orders. The procedure and analysis results are described in this paper.

Here, we propose a strategy of mechanical training to achieve the aligned nanofibrillar architectures of skeletal muscles in synthetic hydrogels, resulting in the combinational muscle-like properties. These properties are obtained through the training-induced alignment of nanofibrils, without additional chemical modifications or additives. In situ confocal microscopy of the hydrogels' fracturing processes reveals that the fatigue resistance results from the crack pinning by the aligned nanofibrils, which require much higher energy to fracture than the corresponding amorphous polymer chains. This strategy is particularly applicable for 3D-printed microstructures of hydrogels, in which we can achieve isotropically fatigue-resistant, strong yet compliant properties.\",\n",

Comparisons with rigid lens adaptation have been used to construct and examine a hypothesis that high levels of initial soft lens comfort increase expectations of an absence of lens awareness that result in end-of-day symptoms being more difficult to tolerate. Results. Relevant reports were referenced in this review having been located using the 143 listed by PubMed. Contact lens-induced corneal hypoalgesia and the association between the influence on blink function of end-of-day general and ocular fatigue, lens front surface degradation, a dysfunctional pre-lens tear layer, and symptoms of dryness suggest that lid wiper friction has a prime role in determining the level of lens awareness. Conclusions. Rather than dry eye symptoms, end-of-day discomfort in CL wearers might be more appropriately described as dry lens symptoms. Apart from tear function, lens condition, compliance with lens care instructions, and symptom strength, lens awareness may also be determined by psychological factors such as motivation, high expectations for comfort, and sense of subjective well-being. For example, high levels of comfort experienced on lens insertion may increase expectations of the level of comfort to be experienced at the end of the day. In addition, patient management seems to require a thorough assessment of lens comfort, which may indicate the need to review a patient's understanding of the relation between compliance and other factors, which could influence CL performance negatively. For example, increased use of digital devices, especially in air conditioning, and any associated reduced blink efficiency seem likely to be important contributors to dry lens symptoms.\",\n",

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pertuzumab (Perjeta, Genentech) for use in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Approval was based on the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC. Patients were randomized (1: 1) to receive pertuzumab (n = 402) or placebo (n = 406) in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and a key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A statistically significant improvement in PFS (difference in medians of 6.1 months) was observed in patients receiving pertuzumab [HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.75; P < 0.0001]. A planned interim analysis suggested an improvement in OS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.88; P = 0.0053) but the HR and P value did not cross the stopping boundary. Common adverse reactions (>30%) observed in patients on the pertuzumab arm included diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. No additive cardiac toxicity was observed. Significant manufacturing issues were identified during the review. On the basis of substantial evidence of efficacy for pertuzumab in MBC and the compelling public health need, FDA did not delay availability to patients pending final resolution of all manufacturing concerns. Therefore, FDA approved pertuzumab but limited its approval to lots not affected by manufacturing problems. The applicant agreed to multiple manufacturing and testing postmarketing commitments under third-party oversight to resolve manufacturing issues. (C) 2013 AACR.',\n",

It is also used as an additive manufacturing and repair technique. In the present work crucible steel CPM9V is deposited over H13 tool steel which could potentially be used for die repair purposes. CO2 laser is used to melt the powder which is deposited by powder injection technique. Note that the dies are exposed to cyclic thermo-mechanical loading and prone to fatigue. Consequently, major issues which needed to be analysed are residual stresses and the heat affected zone. The residual stresses are produced due to high thermal gradients and difference in values of coefficient of thermal expansions of clad and substrate. A three dimensional finite element model is developed to evaluate residual stresses incorporating conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer and assuming temperature dependent thermo-mechanical behaviour for both materials. Experimental analysis is performed using X-ray diffraction technique to evaluate residual stresses and the heat affected zone (HAZ) is characterized via optical microscopy. A comparison between the model predictions and the experimental results shows that model is able to capture the phenomena during the repair process.',\n",

The distinct texture and microstructure distributions were characterised. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements show different lattice activities resulting from the different microstructure distributions. Spatially resolved mapping revealed manufacturing-induced crystallite-orientation distributions that determine the deformation mechanisms. We propose a self-consistent model to correlate the multi-scale characteristics, from the anisotropic-texture-distribution microstructure to the bulk mechanical properties. We determined that basal and pyramidal slip activities were activated by tension deformation. The underlying additive-manufacturing-induced crystal plasticity plays a major role. We find that the texture development of the columnar structures and the distribution of crystallite orientation achieved by different processing conditions during additive manufacturing have important effects on the mechanical properties. The dominant deformation mode for the anisotropic Ti-6Al-4V columnar structure is basal slip, and that for the isotropic Ti-6Al-4V columnar structure is pyramidal slip. The difference may be important for determining the fatigue behaviour.',\n",

However, cavitation erosion may occur in these fluid machine components. The fatigue strength and fatigue life of parts manufactured through AM are weaker than those of bulk metals, and the surfaces of these parts are rough owing to AM. Thus, the cavitation erosion resistance of the AM metal may be weaker than those of bulk metals. In this study, to investigate the cavitation erosion resistance of the AM metal, a cavitation erosion test was conducted by using a cavitating jet. The test specimens of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V manufactured through electron beam melting were treated using various peening methods that succeeded in improving the fatigue strength of the AM metal. The cavitation erosion resistance of the as-built AM metal without surface treatment was much lower than that of the bulk metal. When the results of the AM metal treated using various peening methods were compared with those of the as-built metal, the erosion rate was observed to have decreased by approximately 40% and 95% for cavitation peening and abrasive cavitation peening, respectively. Therefore, it was found that the cavitation erosion resistance of the AM metal can be improved through peening treatment.',\n",

Conventional subtractive processes confront numerous problems due to the complicated structures. The application of selective laser melting (SLM), as one of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, is promising in part fabrication and repairment in the aerospace industry. Tensile tests with different strain rates and strain-controlled cycling tests with different strain amplitudes are conducted in this study at a high temperature of 600 degrees C to assess the mechanical behavior of SLM-built Inconel 718 and reinforce its application. Experimental data reveal that a relatively concise constitutive model incorporating damage is proposed on the basis of Chaboche's framework. Modifications to isotropic hardening and damage evolution rules are performed to embed lifetime prediction capacity. Simulated results achieve a good agreement with the experimental results. Microstructures of fatigue fracture surface are analyzed to further understand the fracture mechanism. The results show that both intergranular and intragranular fracture modes and the dimples signify ductility. Overall, this study presents significant techno-economic implications in assessing the competence of SLM-built Inconel 718 components used in real serving conditions and also provides a reference to improve the SLM preparation process.\",\n",

This paper investigated rheological properties and performance of HMAB as compared to Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) modified binder and neat binder using comprehensive laboratory performance tests. Specifically, the performance of HMAB modified with two different high modulus additives, rock asphalt (RA) and polyolefin (PR), were compared. The performance indicators include linear viscoelasticity characterized by temperature sweep and frequency sweep tests, rutting resistance by multiple-stress creep recovery (MSCR) test, and fatigue resistance by linear amplitude sweep (LAS) test. The effects of high-modulus modifier on master curve of dynamic shear modulus of HMAB were found identical. The temperature dependencies of asphalt binder were found to be significantly dependent on the material source of neat binder. However, the rutting resistance of HMAB modified by rock asphalt and polyolefin is better than that of SBS modified binder and neat binder. The polyolefin modified HMAB showed better rutting resistance than rock asphalt modified HMAB; while the comparison results was opposite for fatigue resistance. The simplified viscoelastic continuum damage (S-VECD) theory was employed to interpret the LAS test results for fatigue life prediction of asphalt binder. The SBS binder showed the best fatigue performance followed by HMAB and neat binder. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

This study aims at evaluating the effect of different pre-treatments onto 316 L substrates processed by laser beam melting (LBM) prior to the deposition of a high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed tungsten carbide-cobalt coating and their effect on the low cycle fatigue strength. Therefore, 316 L substrates were examined in their as-built state as well as after grit blasting with regards to the surface roughness, strain hardening effects, and residual stresses. To differentiate between topographical effects and residual stress related phenomena, stress-relieved 316 L substrates served as reference throughout the investigations.

In this paper, we present the main results from an experimental investigation into the low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior of the alloy in its optimized condition for strength and ductility. To this end, strain-controlled LCF tests were conducted under strain amplitudes ranging from 1% to 2% without the mean strain component. Stress amplitudes showed small hardening with cycles after an initial transient in rapid cyclic hardening followed by rapid cyclic softening. Some anisotropy was observed in the LCF behavior of the alloy. The amplitudes were higher for the samples tested perpendicular to the build direction (BD) than along the BD, consistent with static strength. In contrast, the LCF life was longer for the samples tested long the BD, consistent with ductility. The measured data was used to delineate the strain-life curves for the alloy per test direction based on the CoffinManson model. Additionally, stress-controlled rotary bending HCF fatigue tests were carried out under stress amplitudes ranging from 150 MPa to 750 MPa at room temperature and at 760 degrees C. The HCF life of the alloy was longer at room temperature than at 760 degrees C for all stress amplitudes. In contrast to static strength and LCF, the HCF behavior was found isotropic.

       " [\"Fatigue performance of Inconel 718 (IN718) parts built using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is often poorer than that of the cast and wrought alloy parts. This is because of detrimental effects arising from the microstructures such as brittle phases and anisotropy as well as porosities. To improve fatigue performance of L-PBF IN718, two types of post processes namely hot isostatic pressing (HIP) (performed at 980 degrees C, 100 MPa and 4 h) and shot peening (performed at 0.45 mmA intensity and 200 % coverage) were employed individually as well as sequentially on different specimens in addition to a standard processing route consisting of L-PBF build followed by solution annealing and double aging heat treatment. Porosities were considerably reduced by HIP-ing (from 0.39 % to 0.08 % porosity volume ratio) but this did not translate to improvements in fatigue performance. This can be attributed to the presence of inclusions and yield strength reduction resulting from gamma '' solutionisation. High compressive residual stresses of close to 1 GPa were recorded following shot peening regardless of whether HIP-ing was carried out prior to the shot peening. Improvement in fatigue lives particularly at high stress levels was observed on shot peened specimens without HIP-ing (H + SP) which can be explained by the compressive residual stresses that delay the onset of fatigue crack initiation. Shot peening applied on the HIP-ed specimens (H + HIP + SP) however, resulted in fatigue performance deterioration. This is related to the harmful tensile stresses that must exist alongside the compressive residual stresses in a shot peened surface, as evident from the location of the sub-surface crack initiations near the residual stress transition region approximately 300 mu m from the free surface. In this case, detrimental effects arising from tensile stresses appear to have outweighed the benefits from compressive stresses on fatigue performance.\",\n",

Existing temporal bone rating scales are laborious, subject to evaluator fatigue, and contain inconsistencies when conferring points. To address these deficiencies, a novel binary assessment tool was designed and validated against a well-established rating scale. Methods: Residents completed a mastoidectomy with posterior tympanotomy on identical 3D-printed temporal bone models. Four neurotologists evaluated each specimen using a validated scale (Welling) and a newly developed CanadaWest scale, with scoring repeated after a 4-week interval. Results: Nineteen participants were clustered into junior, intermediate, and senior cohorts. An ANOVA found significant differences between performance of the junior-intermediate and junior-senior cohorts for both Welling and CanadaWest scales (P < .05). Neither scale found a significant difference between intermediate-senior resident performance (P > .05). Cohen's kappa found strong intrarater reliability (0.711) with a high degree of interrater reliability of (0.858) for the CanadaWest scale, similar to scores on the Welling scale of (0.713) and (0.917), respectively.

Those hidden stresses can be detrimental to a part's mechanical properties and fatigue life; therefore, it is crucial to know their magnitude and orientation. The hole-drilling strain-gage method was used to determine the RS magnitude and direction-depth profiles. Cuboid specimens in the as-built state, and after standard solution annealing and ageing heat treatment conditions, were prepared to study the RS evolution throughout the heat treatment stages. Measurements were performed on the top and lateral surfaces. In the as-built specimens, tensile stresses of similar to 400 MPa on the top and above 600 MPa on the lateral surface were obtained. On the lateral surface, RS anisotropy was noticed, with the horizontally aligned stresses being three times lower than the vertically aligned. RS decreased markedly after the first heat treatment. On heat-treated specimens, magnitude oscillations were observed. By microstructure analysis, the presence of carbides was verified, which is a probable root for the oscillations. Furthermore, compressive stresses immediate to the surface were obtained in heat-treated specimens, which is not in agreement with the typical characteristics of parts fabricated by PBF-LB, i.e., tensile stresses at the surface and compressive stresses in the part's core.\",\n",

The use of off-the-shelf entry level digital single-lens reflex cameras has lately become a suitable choice even for applications requiring sub-millimetre- level precision especially when the involved devices need to be inexpensive. The drawback of such low-cost cameras is in the trade-off between spatial resolution, frame rate, and burst rate-at the highest available spatial resolution, a high frame rate is either not possible or it has a low burst rate. This may be problematic when monitoring a structural component during a dynamic/fatigue test. In order to estimate specimen motion in such a situation, this paper proposes an innovative sinusoidal fitting based on a least squares adjustment. This method simultaneously processes multiple bursts of data in order to synthetically increase the sampling frequency of the system. The input data for the adjustment comes from a full surface modelling procedure based on a newly proposed generalized 3D polynomial. The experimental results include a beam deformation test performed in a structures laboratory. The new sinusoidal fitting method effectively increased the system temporal resolution three-fold, which improved the precision of the derived parameters with up to two orders of magnitude.

A heat treatment above the recrystallization temperature followed by quenching is shown to create compressive residual stresses that improve the resistance against crack propagation considerably.

Two levels of laser power, scanning speed, and hatching space were used, while the layer thickness was kept constant. The resulting volume energy density was ranged from 20 to 60 J/mm(3), and the build rate, from 12 to 36 cm(3)/h. The manufactured coupons were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the greater influence observed on the microstructure and texture development was caused by the value of laser power, while the lowest, by that of hatching space. Based on the results obtained, the processing optimization strategy aimed at improving the density, superelastic, and fatigue properties of the L-PBF manufactured Ti-18Zr-14Nb alloy was proposed.',\n",

       " ['Additive manufacturing (AM) is associated with a sequence of rapid heating and cooling cycles along with large temperature gradients, developing complex thermal histories which have direct influence on resultant microstructures. Such a dynamic and far-from-equilibrium process leads to distinct microstructural features that are expected to cause changes in the corrosion characteristics of AM stainless steels. Currently such changes are not well understood, consequently inconsistencies and disagreements are frequently found in the literature on the corrosion behaviour of AM stainless steels. This paper performs a critical review of corrosion characteristics of AM stainless steels by assessing the effects of their unique microstructural features on corrosion behaviour, with particular focus on new corrosion phenomena and selected critical forms of localised corrosion including pitting corrosion, erosion-corrosion, intergranular corrosion, fatigue corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. Discussion on the mechanisms of these corrosion phenomena and behaviour, as well as major influencing factors, are undertaken, leading to recommendations and suggestions for future development of AM stainless steels for various corrosive conditions.',\n",

In this paper, nine porosity-related fatigue damage parameters for N-SC super alloys were selected by referring to those parameters originally proposed for casting and 3D printing metal materials as well as the critical plane damage parameters commonly used in N-SC superalloys. According to the plastic constitutive model of single crystals, a crystal plastic finite element (CPFE) model was established to evaluate these different fatigue damage parameters, and the parameters of CPFE were calibrated by the low cycle fatigue (LCF) hysteresis loop obtained from the fatigue test. The evaluation results showed that the geometric mean of stress-strain concentration factor (GCF) k(g) was a satisfactory parameter to quantify the effect of porosity defects on fatigue. Inspired by the discovery and considering the slip systems characteristics of N-SC superalloys, the geometric mean of resolved stress-strain concentration factor (GRCF) k(rg) on slip systems was proposed, and it was found that the max(k(rg), k(g)) could be used to predict the fracture modes of N-SC superalloys. Based on the max (k(rg), k(g)), a porosity-related fatigue life prediction method which can distinguish the fracture modes was put forward. The prediction results showed that the fracture mode prediction results were consistent with the test results, and the life prediction results were also improved compared with the GCF parameter.',\n",

The results indicated that the columnar crystals grew up and then micro-cracks between the lamellar layers were observed. Macro-cracks and delamination appeared with the fatigue cycles increase. Finally, the coating failed. The surface cracks were also observed and propagated during the fatigue tests. The failure behaviors of the transient heat load are as follows: the homogeneous melting and micro-cracks, melting tungsten ejection which enhanced the erosion of tungsten due to the splash and evaporation. In addition, the physical properties of W coatings such as porosity, Vickers hardness were degraded. The roughing phenomenon was not easy to be observed due to the rough surface characteristic of VPS-W coatings. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The presence of porosity is one of the major issues facing additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic components subjected to fatigue loading. In order to study the effect of porosity on the fatigue behaviour, a vast experimental campaign has been undertaken. Seven specimen batches, fabricated by the SLM process with different building directions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) were tested and a large amount of data was obtained. The link between the applied stress, the fatigue life and the pore size is highlighted by using generalized Kitagawa-Takahashi maps. It is shown that the effect of porosity on the fatigue strength is much more pronounced compared to the effect of the microstructure. In the modelling section, two approaches based on fracture mechanics are considered. The first one is based on the Paris law which is used to model long fatigue crack growth. The second approach was proposed by Caton et al. (2001) for modelling small fatigue crack growth. Finally, a simulation of the generalized Kitagawa-Takahashi is presented and good agreement with the experimental data is shown.',\n",

This PCB; assembly has a 3D configuration in nature such that regular 2D modeling is not capable to solve the problem. However, it is impractical to perform a 3D thermal fatigue analysis for this structure due to the very limited time to market requirement in the industry. In order to solve this problem, a 2D fmite element modeling methodology with the use of artifical elements (effective block) to supplement the necessary boundary conditions is proposed. The focus of this paper is put on the calculation of the material properties of the effective block, and also on the application of it to solve the current 3D thermal fatigue problem. The good matching between the 2D modeling results and those from experiments suggests that the proposed methodology is an effective one, in addition to its high efficiency inborn. As 3D modeling comprises larger complexity and requires much heavier computational effort, it is usual to perform 2D modeling before any 3D simulation work for preliminary results. Yet, the 3D condition can be largely degenerated when it comes down to the 2D level.

Cooling time is considered as the main assessment criterion for the thermal analyses whereas the von Mises stress and fatigue life are the key criteria for the mechanical simulations.

Progress was measured through self-report (Children's Depression Inventory), parent-report, and concrete behavioral markers (e.g., reduced number of purging events).

Recently, IN718 has shown great viability for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing of aerospace parts. However, the detailed microstructure-property relationships during thermal profiles typical to LPBF are not yet well understood. Previous works reported interdendritic precipitation of Laves phase. These detrimental particles can be dissolved by heat treatments, however, the detailed nanoscale phase evolution remains unknown. Using atom probe microscopy, we report on the detailed morphological and chemical evolution of phases in IN718 after LPBF with chessboard versus meander scanning strategies, and direct ageing versus homogenization and ageing treatments. Due to differences in scanning vector length, up to 3.6 times larger dendritic structures, double volume fractions of Laves particles, and Al clusters are found in the chessboard strategy.

Bulk specimens made of PA12 and processed via the additive manufacturing technique such as selective laser sintering (SLS) present a layered structure. In case of structural applications, the fatigue performance of SLS PA12 parts is of vital importance and fatigue response studies in these type of materials are still scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the effect of the applied load orientation on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the layered structure of SLS PA12. Design/methodology/approach With the aim of understanding the effect of the applied load with respect to the layer orientation on the fatigue crack growth of SLS PA12, fatigue crack growth tests were carried out at two orientations. The specimens called PARA were orientated in such a way that the applied force direction belongs to the layer plane while in the group called PERP, the tensile force direction is coincident with the build direction, that is, perpendicular to the slice. Besides, special attention has been paid to the analysis of the fracture surfaces of the specimens, linking the micromechanisms of failure with the microstructure of the material. Findings The SLS PA12 specimens tested with the load applied parallel to the layered structure show a little better fatigue response than those tested at perpendicular orientation. The fracture surfaces of the specimens tested at perpendicular orientation are slightly smoother than those tested at parallel orientation. Crazes are the main micromechanism of failure with a crater size of 50 microns, which coincide with the spherulite size. This indicates that the void nucleation of the crazes takes places between lamellae inside the spherulites, and consequently, the craze growth and rupture occurs mainly in a transspherulitic mode. Originality/value PA12 parts manufactured via SLS are becoming more valuable in structural elements in the automative and aeronatical fields. In such applications, fatigue performance is vital for design. Fatigue studies are scarce in literature and even more when dealing with fatigue crack growth behaviour. The value of this work is the analysis of the fatigue crack growth response of these materials taking into account the anisotropic microstructure and to get a better understanding, this behaviour is explained taking into account the micromechanisms of failure and the microstructure of the material.',\n",

Ti-6A1-4V is a common alloy made by this process and has applications in many industries, in particular aerospace and medical industries. Understanding mechanical performance of the additively manufactured materials and components for critical load bearing applications is still in early stages. As such components are typically subjected to cyclic loading, fatigue failure is a major consideration in their design. In addition, due to the multiaxial nature of the loading and/or complex geometries manufactured by AM, the state of stress often includes both normal and shear stresses. However, all the studies so far on fatigue behavior of additive manufactured metals have only considered axial loading, resulting in normal stresses. This study is on torsional fatigue behavior producing shear stresses and, therefore, addresses a major gap in understanding the mechanical behavior of additive manufactured metals in general and for PBF Ti-6AI-4V alloy in particular.

Contrary to the Paris region there is a clear effect of the heat treatment in the near threshold region. For the material heat treated at 380 degrees C and loaded at R = 0.1 the threshold is 3.7 MPam(1/2), for 740 degrees C 2.7 MPam(1/2) and for 900 degrees C 3.5 MPam(1/2). The explanation of the observed dependence of the threshold on the post processing heat treatment is discussed in terms of microstructure and residual stresses. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Stress concentration factors, and potential applicability of theory of critical distances (TCD) were investigated. Fracture surfaces were comparatively analyzed for quasi-static, fatigue and cryogenic failures. Stress-Life curves were determined and MJF-PA12 showed static and fatigue properties comparable to conventional PA12. The blunt notch had limited impact on fatigue strength, with failure onsetting from internal defects.

Commercial layer-by-layer (LbL) automation devices are prohibitively high-priced (especially for academic institutions) with limited flexibility in form factor and potentially software-associated constraints/limitations. In this work, a novel automated multi-beaker dip coater was fabricated to facilitate nano cerium oxide/polymer coatings via an LbL dip coating process and the synthesis of nano ceria films via a novel successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method on a glass substrate. Automation of tasks, such as those mediating the detailed procedures, is essential in producing highly reproducible, consistent products/materials as well as in reducing the time commitments for laboratory researchers. Herein, we detail the construction of a relatively large, yet inexpensive, LbL coating instrument that can operate over 90 cm in the horizontal axis, allowing, for example, up to eight 200 ml beakers with accompanying stir plates. The instrument is operated by simple off-the-shelf electronics to control the path and timing of the samples with open-source software while providing precision at +/- 0.01 mm. Furthermore, 3D-printed components were used to maximize the number of substrates that could be coated simultaneously, further improving the sample production rate and reducing waste. Further possibilities for automation beyond the detailed device are provided and discussed, including software interfaces, physical control methods, and sensors for data collection/analysis or for triggers of automated tasks.',\n",

The results show that annealing at high temperature near the phase boundary enhances the ductility of the brittle mesh struts due to the formation of coarse a lamellas with a large thickness/length ratio. Accordingly, the fatigue endurance ratio of the studied meshes increases to up to similar to 0.6, which is much superior to that of the as-fabricated counterparts and comparable to those of dense materials.

In our demonstration, we showcase a novel approach to bring quick touch interaction to Virtual Reality, illustrating the beneficial use of rapid tapping, typing, and surface gestures for ongoing interaction in Virtual Reality, particularly in the context of content creation and productivity scenarios. The productivity scenarios that become possible using our approach are therefore reminiscent of apps that exist on today's phones and tablets. To reliably make touch interaction work in VR, we use a wrist-worn prototype to complement the optical hand tracking from VR headsets with inertial sensing to detect touch events on surfaces. Our prototype band TapID integrates a pair of inertial sensors in a flexible strap, from whose signals TapID reliably detects surface touch events and identifies the finger used for touch. This event detection is then fused with the optically tracked hand poses to trigger input in VR. Our demonstration comprises a series of VR applications, including UI control in word processors, web browsers, and document editors.\",\n",

Excess Bi promotes crystallization of the film. The crystalline films have been obtained on Pt and SiO2/Si even at 350 degrees C, which is the lowest process temperature for growing SET ferroelectric thin films. Metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MRS) structure, which is very important in ferroelectric gate memory FET, has been fabricated by depositing the SET film on insulator-silicon, The MFIS structures show C-V hysteresis corresponding to ferroelectric hysteresis. Memory windows of the C-V hysteresis are 4.3 V in the SBT/SiO2/Si and 2.5 V in the SBT/SiNx/SiO2/Si. The memory window and fatigue property of the C-V characteristics are improved with decrease of the deposition temperature and the excess Pi content, Little degradations are induced in the C-V characteristics of SiNx/SiO2/n-Si structure when depositing the SET film by PLD at low temperature.

       " [\"Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) of Ti-6Al-4V enables the manufacturing of complex parts for lightweight applications. The emerging microstructure in the LPBF process and thus the mechanical properties are defined by the thermal cycles, which are locally variable for complex geometries. Predictions of local mechanical properties by simulation would reduce the development time of new applications drastically but are today not possible on part scale, so new part applications must be qualified experimentally at great effort. In this study, representative geometry sections were transferred into a simplified sample shape to mechanically characterize different geometry-dependent microstructures. In areas exposed to comparatively increased heat input over time, a lamellar alpha + beta microstructure with beta fraction up to 20% was measured in contrast to the common martensitic alpha' microstructure of LPBF-manufactured Ti-6Al-4V, resulting in reduced tensile strength and fatigue life. For the first time, a correlation was successfully established between ultimate tensile strength of multiple geometries and the corresponding temperature-time cycles. With reduced computational effort by use of simplifying assumptions in the simulation, this correlation model can theoretically be applied to the part level. This work has laid the foundation for the simulation-based prediction of mechanical properties for entire parts manufactured with LPBF.\",\n",

A two-by-two factorial plan was arranged, to experimentally assess the effects of heat treatment and machining on the fatigue strength in both finite and infinite life domains. The two factors were regarded as on-off, taking the untreated unmachined condition as a reference for comparisons. Cylindrical specimens with vertical build orientation were involved in the fatigue campaign under four-point rotating bending. The results indicate that the fatigue strength may be remarkably incremented (up to five times) with respect to the as received conditions, especially thanks to surface smoothing and taking advantage of a very low porosity level. Heat treatment strengthening mechanisms were also interpreted in the light of optical and electron microscope observations. Fatigue enhancement arises from precipitate size increment throughout the conducted heat treatment, although the fracture mode turns to be more brittle.',\n",

For this particular alloy, post-SLM heat treatment was found to be necessary in order to improve its tensile strength and fatigue behavior in low cycle fatigue (LCF), where the effects of microstructural impurities are less pronounced. However, the selected heat treatment was found to have detrimental influence on the SLM 17-4 PH SS high cycle fatigue (HCF) performance. The heat treatment resulted in precipitation hardening, allowing the SLM parts to. become more sensitive to impurities in HCF, where the crack initiation stage dominates the total fatigue lifetime. Building orientation played a significant role on fatigue behavior in both LCF and HCF, owing to the relative orientation of deposited layers with respect to applied load. Un-melted regions (i.e. inter layer cavities/voids), resulting from insufficient fusion or low laser penetration depth, were found to be the most detrimental type of defects on fatigue strength of SLM 17-4 PH SS due to their relatively large size and irregular shape. These specific regions that formed during fabrication of vertically-orientated samples were more detrimental than those of horizontally-built ones as they provided more stress concentration under loading, leading to lower fatigue strength. Although the process parameters were optimized based on maximizing density, the results of this study imply that this criterion is not sufficient for improving fatigue behavior, as the split-shaped un-melted regions, containing a large area with small volume, cannot be taken into account through conventional density measurements.

From the cyclic test results, the bracket has demonstrated that it meets the target LCF performance which was in excess of the normal expected operating loads that the LPBF bracket would experience. The failures in the bracket at different locations were observed only under the extreme loading conditions. The failure of the bracket was of a progressive nature with failure of different struts/connectors happening at different discrete cycles. Even after the first five failures, the LPBF bracket had 47% of the original load carrying capacity in the tensile part of the hysteresis loop, indicating a good redundancy in its load transfer paths. In general, the surface locations of the bracket struts/connectors, where there are lack of fusion voids, were the prime sites for crack initiation. If any of these locations also coincide with high stresses, i.e. the combination of 'size of defect' and 'magnitude of stress', then this will contribute to an increased likelihood of failure at these locations in the LPBF bracket.\",\n",

The landmarks of the driver's face were labeled and the eye-area was segmented. By calculating the aspect ratios of the eyes, the duration of eye closure, frequency of blinks and PERCLOS of both colored and infrared, fatigue can be detected.

It is often treated with artificial tears that must have enhanced viscosity in comparison with human tears. Phosphorylated low molecular weight PVA was synthesized to obtain a viscosity enhancer for the production of artificial tears. Three different concentrations were analyzed, verifying that, thanks to the combined action of low molecular weight and presence of anionic groups inserted along the chains, formulations can be sterilized by filtration without losing their viscosity properties, stability and transparency (light trasmittance > 85%). Formulations were characterized by Infrared and UV spectroscopy, thermal analyses and rheology. The developed viscosity enhancer shows adequate viscosity values for the foreseen application. Indeed, its viscosity is higher than natural tears (1.5 mPa.s) but lower than 30 mPa.s (sticky sensation) at the shear stress values the eye is subjected. It shows a mean viscosity value of 20 mPa.s at shear rate 1 s(-1) (interblinking phase: open eye), and 10.5 mPa.s at 10,000 s(-1) (blinking phase).',\n",

Therefore, herein we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials on combination ICI to synthesize the treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) profile of combination ICI therapy. Methods: PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database/EBM were searched for eligible studies. Clinical trials evaluating combination immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in advanced unresectable cancer were included in the analysis based on prespecified criteria. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test. The summary outcomes were pooled risk ratios (RR) and the logit-transformed proportion for incidence data. Results: A total of 18 studies comprising 2,767 patients across 10 cancer types were included in the final analysis. Combination ICI was associated with a slightly higher risk of all-grade adverse events (RR 1.07 [95% CI 1.03-1.11]) and markedly greater risk of grade 3 or higher adverse events (RR 2.21 [95% CI 1.57-3.10]) compared to monotherapy ICI. Subgroup analyses showed significant differences in risk of grade 3 or higher adverse events between treatment types (PD-1 + CTLA-4 and PD-L1 + CTLA-4), among cancer types, and among dosing regimens (N1I3, N3I1, and D20T1). The incidence of all-grade adverse events was 0.905 [95% CI 0.842-0.945], and the ratio of grade 3 or higher events to all-grade adverse events was 0.396 [95% CI 0.315-0.483]. The most common all-grade TRAEs were diarrhea/colitis, fatigue/asthenia, nausea/vomiting, rash, and pruritis. Conclusion: Combination ICI therapy has a significantly different treatment-related adverse event profile compared to monotherapy.\",\n",

To improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of LSFed Inconel 718 superalloy, electromagnetic stirring (EMS) was introduced to alter the solidification process of the molten pool during LSF. The results show that EMS could not completely eliminate the epitaxially growing columnar grains, however, the strong convection of liquid metals can effectively influence the solid-liquid interface growing mode. The segregation of alloying elements on the front of solid-liquid interface is inhibited and the degree of constitutional supercooling decreases correspondingly. Comparing the microstructures of samples formed under different process parameters, the size and amount of the gamma+Laves eutectic phases formed in interdendritic area decrease along with the increasing magnetic field intensity, resulting in more uniformly distributed alloying elements. The residual stress distribution is proved to be more uniform, which is beneficial to the grain refinement after recrystallilzaiton. Mechanical properties testing results show an improvement of 100 MPa in tensile strength and 22% in elongation was obtained after EMS was used. The high cycle fatigue properties at room temperature was also improved from 4.09 x 10(4) cycles to 8.21 x 10(4) cycles for the as-deposited samples, and from 5.45 x 10(4) cycles to 12.73 x 10(4) cycles for the heat treated samples respectively.

Boron and aluminum coordination numbers were quantified for recovered samples by B-11 magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy at ambient pressure and temperature. The average coordination numbers increase as the glass was compressed to higher pressure and the glass with higher concentration of boron shows higher recoverable densification. The atomic structure changes can be represented by oxygen packing density, Young's modulus and Vickers hardness number show good correlations with oxygen packing density as well. In general Poisson's ratio decreases as the average coordination number of network formers increases, however the interpretation of the changes in Poisson's ratio with pressure for each glass composition presents a more complicated case and no straightforward trend with compaction was found.\",\n",

The FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of only two (2) active functional group (TeO3 and TeO4) in the wavenumber range of 200-4000 cm(-1). The spectra of the XRD confirmed the glassy and amorphous nature of the studied glasses. With the addition of more Nd2O3 in the glass composition, both the density and molar volume increased. The elastic moduli (longitudinal modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Bulk modulus) were calculated from the measured density and ultrasonic velocities obtained from the non-destructive ultrasonic testing performed at 5 MHz frequency. The experimental results showed that the elastic moduli and density rely upon the composition of the glass system and the impact of Nd2O3 within the glass network. The increase in ultrasonic velocities and the elastic moduli is associated with the increase in rigidity and change in the structural network of the glass system. The effects of Nd2O3 on the Debye temperature, softening temperature, micro-hardness and Poisson's ratio of TeO2-ZnO-Ag2O glasses were also studied in this work. The acoustic impedance, as well as the coefficient of thermal expansion of the studied glasses, were also calculated. The elastic and the physical properties' parameters suggest that the glasses are strong enough for utilization in both fibre and laser technology.\",\n",

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that the network of these glasses consists mainly of BO3, BO4, SiO4, and PbO4 structural units. The thermal stability of the glass samples determined by differential thermal analysis was found to be about 80 degrees C. Dilatometric measurements showed that the glass transition temperature and dilatometric softening temperature decrease with increasing lead content, whereas the coefficient of thermal expansion increases. The density and molar volume increased with the increase in lead content. The conductivity of the investigated glasses mainly depends on the mobility of F- and Pb2+ ions. The variation in volume resistance upon changing the composition has been correlated with the structural changes in the glass network.

This paper employs ethyl phenylacetate cured dicyclopentadiene phenol (DCPD) epoxy resin as the matrix and incorporates KH550 coupling-agent-treated SiO2 hollow glass microspheres to produce composite materials with low dielectric, high heat resistance, and high modulus. These materials are applied as insulation films for high density interconnect (HDI) and substrate-like printed circuit board (SLP) boards.

Here, it is revisited using three model systems: a series of oligomeric and polymeric cyanurates, blends of oligomeric and polymeric alpha-methyl styrene, and molecular mixtures of itraconazole and posaconazole. We evaluate several entropy-based models to determine the theoretical T-g as a function of molecular composition and compare the results against the experimental data. The assumption that the configurational entropy is invariant at the T-g is tested, where the change in configurational entropy is assumed to be given by the integral of Delta C(p)dlnT, where Delta C-p is the temperature-dependent change in the heat capacity at T-g. We find that, although the temperature-dependent heat capacities in both liquid and glassy states are nearly independent of composition for several of the systems studied (i.e., they are nearly ideal mixtures), the composition dependence of T-g is not well described by simply adding the changes in the mass-weighted configurational entropy of the components on going from the T-g in the pure state to that of the blend.

The lowest frequency mode is found to dominate the total THz dielectric strength. Among various glasses, the high frequency (optical) dielectric constant shows a superlinear dependence on the electronic polarizability of oxygens. In contrast, the low frequency (THz) mode contribution to the dielectric constant is enhanced by the ionicity (expressed by the polarization ionicity parameter) and exhibits an even steeper dependence on the electronic polarizability. This feature well explains the mechanism of attaining the highest THz dielectric constant in an OFS glass (e.g. ZNbKLSNd glass). Also, the oxygen ion effective charges bearing the lowest frequency modes of OFS glasses are evaluated and found to behave consistently with the polarization ionicity parameter, confirming the relevance of both of these parameters as good ionicity indicators.',\n",

The effect of UV aging on the transformation, aggregation and motion state of asphalt microstructure is analyzed by the changes in energy, microstructural morphological variation, glass transition temperature and viscosity of the asphalt molecular system. The results show that the Satruate and Aromatic provide the active force for the asphalt molecules, the Asphaltene and Resin provide the bonding force for the asphalt molecules. As the UV aging progresses, the lightweight components of the asphalt molecule gradually transform into heavy components. UV aging enhances the bonding degree of asphalt molecules by increasing the heavy components in the asphalt molecules and increasing the distribution width between the asphalt molecule components, which improves the high-temperature resistance of asphalt. At the meantime, the UV aging causes the asphalt molecular movement state to solidify at low temperature so that the rheological behavior is difficult to occur by reducing the lightweight component and free volume of the asphalt molecule and increasing the glass transition temperature, which reduces the low-temperature resistance of asphalt. In addition, among the factors affecting the viscosity of asphalt molecular, the degree of effect of the molecular structure and molecular weight is significantly greater than the molecular activity. Adding short-chain alkanes, multi-branched long-chain alkanes and preventing the synthesis and aggregation of condensed nucleus compounds in the UV-aged asphalt molecule could effectively reduce the viscosity of the asphalt and improve the flowability of the asphalt, thus enhancing the low-temperature resistance of UV-aged asphalt.

As demonstrated by the results, upon adding barium oxide to the glass structure, the weight density increased significantly, while a slight decrease in oxygen density was determined. Introducing barium oxide into glass composition did not cause any considerable change in the spectra of FTIR and Raman. It was demonstrated that the amount of bridging oxygen in the glass structure remained quite unaffected. The hot stage microscopy evaluations revealed further shrinkage of bariumcontaining frits due to lower viscosity and hence, higher viscous flow of these glasses. By substituting barium oxide for calcium oxide and increasing its concentration, the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the dilatometric softening temperature (Td) decreased, while the thermal expansion coefficient increased. Moreover, upon substituting 9 mol.% barium oxide for calcium oxide, a 30 degrees C reduction in maximum sintering temperature (Tms) of the glass was obtained, whereas the shrinkage rate was increased 1.7 times.

To this end, the molecular dynamics method was adopted to study the influence of the PU modifier on the compatibility, mechanical properties, and structure of asphalt. Using the Materials Studio software, a four-component molecular model of asphalt, a PU molecular model, and an asphalt-PU mixed system model were constructed, and the molecular density and glass transition temperature (Tg) were used to verify the performance of the aforementioned models. Molecular dynamics simulations of the three molecular models were conducted under different temperatures, and the solubility parameter (delta), interaction energy, mechanical properties, and radial distribution functions (RDFs) were obtained. The results showed that at 413.15 K (140 degrees C), the difference between the solubility parameters of the asphalt and PU molecules ( increment delta) is the smallest, and their interaction reaches the most optimal phase state. The effects of the PU modifier on the Young's modulus, bulk modulus, and shear modulus of asphalt were studied. Finally, the RDF analysis showed that the PU modifier has a direct effect on the degree of swelling and dispersion between the aromatic-aromatic and saturate-saturate components in the asphalt, reducing the aggregation of both molecules. This verifies the PU modification effect.\",\n",

EEVE was homopolymerized and copolymerized with cyclohexyl vinyl ether (CHVE) via carbocationic polymerization to produce linear polymers. These eugenol-based polymers were evaluated for their ability to produce alkyd-type surface coatings via autoxidative crosslinking. The EEVE-based polymers can provide several advantages over conventional air-drying alkyd resins such as energy-efficient polymerization, precise control over composition and molar mass, and elimination of issues associated with gelation during polymerization. The EEVE-based coatings showed significantly higher chemical resistance, hardness, glass transition temperature, and Young's modulus compared to a commercial alkyd coating. The base resistance of EEVE-based coatings was significantly improved compared to conventional air-drying alkyd resins. As expected, incorporation of the CHVE to the poly(vinyl ether) polymer backbone significantly increased the glass transition temperature and mechanical properties of the crosslinked networks. The optimum physical and thermomechanical properties for the EEVE/CHVE copolymers were obtained at 25 wt% loading of CHVE monomer. Overall, the results of the study suggest a high potential for these eugenol-derived biobased monomers and polymers for applications in airdrying coatings.\",\n",

In the present work, the correlation of the quantity E with such characteristics as the total molar mass M of alloy components, the number of components n forming an alloy, the yield stress & sigma;y and the glass transition temperature Tg has been studied in detail based on a large set of empirical data for the Young's modulus of different amorphous metal alloys. It has been established that the values of the Young's modulus of metal alloys under normal conditions correlate with such a mechanical characteristic as the yield stress as well as with the glass transition temperature. As found, the specificity of the chemical formulaof alloy, which is determined by molar mass M and number of components n, does not affect on elasticity of the material. The machine learning algorithm identified both the quantities M and n as insignificant factors in determining E.

In the present study, the atomic-level structures and mechanical properties of Zr-based MGs doped with different O contents have been analyzed using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. It is revealed that O atoms prefer to bond to Zr atoms due to their low mixing enthalpy, and that O atoms degrade the properties of Zr-lean MGs but hardly affect the properties of Zr-rich MGs, with results suggesting a compositional dependence of O doping. For Zr-lean MGs, the fraction of full icosahedra, size of the medium-range-order clusters, Young's modulus and shear modulus decrease sharply with O content, while accompanied by a sharp increase of the non-Frank-Kasper polyhedra, and the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus and Poisson's ratio, indicating decreased strength and improved plasticity. For Zr-rich MGs, however, the above-mentioned structural and mechanical features experience little change or only change slightly after O doping, showing low oxygen sensitivity. It is shown that the high Zr content weakens the effect of Zr-O bonding to some extent. The present study not only sheds light on the atomic-level structures of O-doped MGs, which may provide guidelines for designing MGs with low-grade materials, but also helps to explain the previous conflicting results based on the composition-dependence effect.\",\n",

Soda-lime-silica glasses with Na2O-MgO-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 compositions relevant to commercial glass manufacture were experimentally studied and multiple liquidus temperature and viscosity models were used to complement the experimental results. Liquidus temperatures of the fabricated glasses were measured by the temperature gradient technique, and Rietveld refinements were applied to X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) data for devitrified glasses, enabling quantitative determination of the crystalline and amorphous fractions and the nature of the crystals. Structural properties were investigated by Raman spectroscopy.

It is shown that it is possible to design lower-melting soda-lime-silica glass compositions without compromising their mechanical and crystallization properties. Unlike Young's modulus, brittleness is highly responsive to the composition in soda-lime-silica glasses, and notably low brittleness values can be obtained in glasses with compositions in the wollastonite primary phase field: an effect that is more pronounced in the silica primary phase field.

This anomaly refers to the nonmonotonic compositional scaling of properties exhibited by alkali germanate glasses and has been studied with various spectroscopy techniques. However, it has been difficult to understand its atomic scale origin, especially since the germanium nucleus is not easily observed by nuclear magnetic resonance. To gain insights into the mechanisms of the germanate anomaly, we have constructed a structural model using statistical mechanics and topological constraint theory to provide an accurate prediction of alkali germanate glass properties. The temperature onsets for the rigid bond constraints are deduced from in situ Brillouin light scattering, and the number of constraints is shown to be accurately calculable using statistical methods. The alkali germanate model accurately captures the effect of the germanate anomaly on glass transition temperature, liquid fragility, and Young's modulus. We also reveal that compositional variations in the glass transition temperature and Young's modulus are governed by the O-Ge-O angular constraints, whereas the variations in fragility are governed by the Ge-O radial constraints.\",\n",

The ionic conductivities of the polyether and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide mixtures ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-3) S/cm. In this higher-dielectric-constant regime, here defined as a polymer with a dielectric constant greater than that of poly(ethylene oxide) (ca. 9.0), the glass transition temperature increased with dielectric constant while ionic conductivity decreased. These results complement a recent report on the low-dielectric-constant regime, where the ionic conductivity was limited by the dielectric constant and ion dissociation. In the high-dielectric-constant regime explored here, segmental dynamics are slowed due to stronger polymer-polymer and polymer-ion interactions, resulting in decreased ionic conductivity and associated increase in neat polymer glass transition temperature. The disparate chemical structures of the polymers of this study, along with the results of past coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, support the generality of these conclusions and speak to the difficulty of identifying a single molecular characteristic leading to the design of high-conductivity polymer electrolytes. Widely used poly(ethylene oxide) represents a near-optimal balance between the low-and high-dielectric-constant regimes.

Their Young's modulus and fracture toughness reach 170 GPa and 1.4 MPa m(.5), respectively. Most reports show good linear relationships between glass property values and nitrogen content. There is a clear linear dependence of Young's modulus and microhardness on fractional glass compactness (atomic packing density). They also have a better resistance to surface damage induced by indentation or scratch loading. The improvements stem from the increase of the atomic network cross-linking-because of three-fold coordinated nitrogen-and of the atomic packing density, despite nitrogen being lighter than oxygen and the Si-N bond being weaker than the Si-O bond. For constant cation composition, viscosity increases by similar to 3 orders of magnitude as similar to 17 eq.% oxygen is replaced by nitrogen. For rare earth oxynitride glasses with constant N content, viscosity, Young's modulus, Tg, and other properties increase with increasing cation field strength (decreasing ionic radius). Research continues to find lighter, stiffer materials, including glasses, with superior mechanical properties. With higher elastic moduli, hardness, fracture toughness, strength, surface damage resistance, increased high temperature properties, oxynitride glasses offer advantages over their oxide counterparts.\",\n",

Solubility measurements, using electron microscopy chemical analysis, determined the maximum loading to be 1.2 mass% SO3. It was found that measured sulfur (here as sulfate) additions up to 1.18 mass% increased the glass transition temperature by 3%, thermal diffusivity by 11%, heat capacity by 10%, and thermal conductivity by 20%, and decreased the mass density by 1%. Structural analysis, performed with Raman spectroscopy, indicated that the borosilicate network polymerized with sulfur additions up to 3.0 mass%, presumably due to Na2O being required to charge compensate the ionic SO42- additions, thus becoming unavailable to form non-bridging oxygen in the silicate network. It is postulated that this increased cross-linking of the borosilicate backbone led to a structure with higher dimensionality and average bond energy. This increased the mean free paths and vibration frequency of the phonons, which resulted in the observed increase in thermal properties.',\n",

Glass, with its naturally high refractive index and mechanical properties, is considered an ideal candidate for high-end lenses, however, due to the lack of targeted design, the intrinsic hardness, modulus and fracture toughness of conventional glass are low and its scratch resistance is inadequate.

       " [\"To shorten the cure cycle for thermoset prepreg composites, we can either increase the heating rate or the curing temperature. However, this raises the question whether modifying the cure cycle affects the laminate microstructure and physical and mechanical properties. Current state-of-the-art aerospace prepreg composites incorporate thermoplastic particles into the interlayer to increase delamination and impact resistance, which creates a more complicated composition and laminate microstructure. This research investigates the effect of curing conditions on the microstructure and elastic properties of an interlayer toughened prepreg system, Toray's T800SC/3900-2B. Laminates were processed to the same degree of cure using cure cycles with different heating rates. Optical microscopy showed that microstructural characteristics such as the interlayer thickness, particle shape, particle volume fraction and inter-particle distance are dependent on curing conditions. It was found that the glass transition temperature of the toughening particle, the resin viscosity and the elastic deformation of the fibre bed are important for the cure-dependent microstructural evolution at the pre-gelation stage. The out-of plane lamina shear modulus (G13) dependence on temperature of fully cured laminates was measured with Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The lamina G13 decreases with increasing cure cycle heating rate at 150-200 degrees C, where toughening particles are rubbery and the matrix is glassy. A micromechanical model demonstrates that the reduction of lamina G13 at higher heating rates results from a decrease in the interlayer shear modulus. Interlayer microstructural features such as particle volume fraction, particle aspect ratio and interparticle contact contribute to the cure path dependence of the interlayer shear modulus. This study provides insight into the fundamental processing behavior of interlayer toughened prepregs and the influence on elastic properties.\",\n",

The effect plays an important role since it can be applied to design glasses with controlled properties and it is also related to the raw materials selection. In this review, we will summarize the recent important progress on the mixed modifier effect in oxide glasses. The effect has been found in various properties, but we mainly focus on glass transition temperature (Tg), hardness (H), elastic modulus (E), and coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha) since these properties are critical in glass manufacture and products performance. Different properties exhibit unique features and many theories are proposed to account for the effect.

The modification of starting 40Na(2)O-60P(2)O(5) glass by Nb2O5 revealed changes both in the structure and properties. The glass density steeply increases with increasing Nb2O5 content while the molar volume decreases. Parent sodium ultraphosphate glass was covered with a thin layer of partially hydrolysed glass in air. The chemical durability of Nb2O5 containing glasses was high. The replacement of P2O5 by Nb2O5 resulted in a gradual increase in the refraction index as well as in an increase in glass transition temperature and dilatometric softening temperature. DSC measurements demonstrated that glasses crystallize under heating in the temperature range of 330-880 degrees C. The lowest thermal stability was found for the glass containing 40 mol% Nb2O5. The Raman and NMR spectra indicated that the structure of 40Na(2)O-60P(2)O(5) glass is formed mainly by Q(2) and Q(1) phosphate units interconnected by P-O-P bonds.

The CBS-1 glass-ceramic exhibited the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE = 3.2 ppm/degrees C), lowest dielectric constant (epsilon(r) = 4.04) at 60 GHz, and highest dielectric loss (tan delta = 0.0029) at 60 GHz, which were attributed to the presence of quartz (SiO2) as the major phase. In contrast, as the major phase constituent of the CBS-2 and CBS-3 glass-ceramics was beta-CaSiO3, they presented relatively high CTEs (6.6 and 5.9 ppm/degrees C, respectively), relatively high dielectric constants at 60 GHz (6.29 and 7.61, respectively), and relatively low dielectric losses at 60 GHz (0.0020 and 0.0012, respectively). The CBS-1 glass-ceramic exhibited the highest dielectric loss because of the presence of SiO2 as the major phase constituent as well as lattice scattering induced by the high glassy phase content. The thermal conductivities (kappa) of the CBS-1, CBS-2, and CBS-3 glass-ceramics were determined to be 2.43, 1.06, and 0.82 W/mK, respectively. Structural analysis using Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed an absence of nonbridging oxygen in the CBS-1 glass-ceramic, while the high CaO content (>40 mol%) of the CBS-2 and CBS-3 glass-ceramics triggered the formation of nonbridging oxygen in the tetrahedral silicate units. The increase in CaO content of the glass-ceramics increased the number of nonbridging oxygen atoms, thereby resulting in the relaxation of the structure. Consequently, the CBS-2 and CBS-3 glass-ceramics exhibited low thermal conductivity. All the prepared glass-ceramics presented high electrical resistivities of greater than 5 x 10(11) Omega cm. The CBS-1 glass-ceramic displayed the highest breakdown strength of 15.20 kV/mm.

In this study, aluminum AlMgSi0.5 (EN AW-6060) was coated onto silicon nitride Si3N4 ceramic substrates using friction surfacing technology. Experimental work revealed that the harmful effects of thermal shock (e.g., substrate cracking, coating delamination) observed with other material combinations can be avoided by selecting materials with a low coefficient of thermal expansion, low Young's modulus and high thermal conductivity. Design of experiments derived models for coating thickness and bonding strength fit the data well (i.e., the regression model accounts for most of the variation in the response variable). Whereas the coating thickness is predominately dependent on the rotational speed used, the bonding strength is also affected by the traverse speed. Coating thicknesses upto 2.03 mm and bonding strengths of 42.5 MPa were achieved. Deposition rates exceed those of physical vapor deposition by a magnitude of x1000 and bonding strength is on-par with thin-film metallization. Scanning transmission electron microscope analysis revealed formation of a glassy phase at the interface. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis high silicon and oxygen content with smaller percentages of aluminum and nitrogen were detected.

The synthesized copolyesters were analyzed by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, FT-IR, GPC, intrinsic viscosity, DSC, TGA and tensile testing, respectively.

The introduction of BDA into PCT chains can effectively lower the melting point of PCT, making it easier to process. The glass transition temperature of PCTB is higher than 103 degrees C and its thermal stability is better than that of PCT. The rheological tests confirm the enhanced melting stability of PCT after introducing BDA into PCT chains.

The optimization of chemical composition is required to produce silicate glasses with desirable CTE for specific applications. The traditional composition optimization approach relies on a trial-and-error laboratory experimentation process which is highly time-consuming. In order to expedite the optimization process, a mathematical model need to be developed that can predict CTE with given oxide glass composition. For this purpose, an ever-increasing interest of worldwide science community have recently been witnessed in data-driven machine learning models. These models have shown interesting as well as encouraging results for many such applications. The present study focuses on building the random forest machine learning regression model for predicting CTE of silicate glasses. The mole fractions of glass constituents (Al2O3, B2O3, Na2O, MgO, CaO, BaO, and SiO2) are considered model input features for predicting CTE. The figures of merit used to evaluate of the model performance are regression coefficient (R-2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The R-2 and MAPE of the model are 0.95 and 8.44 respectively in predicting the CTE of unseen glasses, which demonstrate a reasonably good model performance. The model revealed that the mole fraction of Na2O has distinctively high feature importance compared to the rest of the constituents in predicting CTE.

To investigate the deformability of glassy inclusions in CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 and MnO-Al2O3-SiO2 systems, experimental and numerical methods were used. Young's modulus values of some glasses based on the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 and MnO-Al2O3-SiO2 systems, which correspond to typical inclusions in tire cord steel, were measured with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The effect of basicity, defined as the ratio of mass percentage of CaO to SiO2, on Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were investigated. The Young's moduli of glasses are enhanced with increasing basicity, which could be attributed to the high field strength of calcium ions. The Poisson's ratios of glasses also show an increase tendency with increasing basicity, which could be due to the loss of rigidity of network with introduction of calcium ions. The equations in the literature for Young's modulus calculation were evaluated based on the present and literature data. Appen's equation is modified by re-fitting the present and literature data to give accurate estimation of Young's modulus with the mean deviation of 2%.

       " ['Deep eutectic solvents have become attractive alternatives to conventional solvents due to their inter-esting characteristics such as physicochemical properties, low cost of components, easiness to prepare, low toxicity, bio renewability and biodegradability. To make the deep eutectic mixture more cost effec-tive and renewable, carbohydrate was linked with the deep eutectic mixture, since, carbohydrates are the most significant renewable compound. In this work, we have used low melting mixtures comprised of carbohydrates to create reaction media for organic transformations. The physical properties such as density, viscosity, acidity, refractive index, surface tension, solubility, glass transition temperature, and thermal stability of the mixture were studied. Glycerol: Urea: NH4Cl low melting mixture was employed as reaction medium and catalyst for the effective synthesis of Benzopyranophenazine carbonitrile which made the reaction cost effective, saf e and reduced the use of organic solvent. The reaction between o-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1,4 naphthoquinone, malononitrile and aldehyde was performed effec-tively with good to excellent yields.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

       " [\"Core-double-shell-structured nanocomposite films consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride-grafted-barium titanate (PVDF-g-BT) incorporated into a P(VDF-co-hexafluoropropylene (HFP)) copolymer matrix were produced via a solution mixing method for energy storage applications. The resulting films were thoroughly investigated via spectroscopic, thermal, and morphological analyses. Thermogravimetric data provided an enhancement of the thermal stability, while differential scanning calorimetry indicated an increase in the crystallinity of the films after the addition of PVDF-g-BT. Moreover, broadband dielectric spectroscopy revealed three dielectric processes, namely, glass-rubber relaxation (a(a)), relaxation associated with the polymer crystalline phase (a(c)), and slower relaxation in the nanocomposites resulting from the accumulation of charge on the interface between the PVDF-g-BT filler and the P(VDF-co-HFP) matrix. The dependence of the dielectric constant from the composition was analyzed, and we found that the highest permittivity enhancement was obtained by the highest concentration filler added to the largest concentration of P(VDF-co-HFP). Mechanical analysis revealed an improvement in Young's modulus for all nanocomposites versus pristine P(VDF-co-HFP), confirming the uniformity of the distribution of the PVDF-g-BT nanocomposite with a strong interaction with the copolymer matrix, as also evidenced via scanning electron microscopy. The suggested system is promising for use in high-energy-density storage devices as supercapacitors.\",\n",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and capillary viscometer results revealed that EC hydrolysis significantly decreased glass transition temperature (Tg) and intrinsic viscosity. FTIR spectra of hydrolysed EC (H-EC) revealed a breakdown of many glycosidic bonds. The oleogels were prepared by H-EC at the concentration of 6 wt%. Results showed that hydrolysis conditions significantly affected oleogel formation and strength. An optimal oleogel structure was achieved with H-EC at 65 degrees C, 50/50 solvent ratio (H-EC65/50). The rheological analysis of H-EC65/50 oleogel showed higher strength and a lower melting temperature range than EC oleogel. Microscopic observations confirmed that the H-EC65/50 forms a new structure with many small cavities, probably the main reason for the firmer gel. The prepared formulation could have potential to prepare reduced fat formulations with the suitable melting point and texture.',\n",

The natural variability of the mineral compositions used in raw glazes affects their viscosity during firing. Molten glaze viscosity plays an important role in determining the final surface quality; therefore, it is important to determine how raw glaze composition and firing conditions affect viscosity. Thermophysical modeling provides a way to evaluate the liquidus temperature and viscosity of molten glazes as a function of composition and oxygen activity. Equilibrium phase volume fraction and composition of 242 raw glaze recipes were evaluated under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Undissolved or precipitation of solid phases explains the secondary flux transition from anti-fluxing to fluxing near the liquidus temperature. The liquidus temperature and viscosity of iron glazes decrease as a function of increasing iron content under a reducing atmosphere. The empirical probability distribution of molten glaze viscosity follows a lognormal distribution, with lead glazes having significantly lower viscosity compared with glazes without lead. The peak firing temperature viscosity of lead-free glazes is near the working point of glass. Multiple linear regression analysis shows that the peak firing temperature viscosity and liquidus temperature significantly predict the viscosity factor.',\n",

To achieve the viscosity-reducing effect of asphalt, the wax-based warm-mix agents from waste polyethylene were synthesized via a catalytic cracking method, followed by the melt-mixing process of such agent and base asphalt. The effective relationship between chemical composition/structure of warm-mix agents and properties of asphalt composites was established, and the effects of synthesized warm-mix agents on viscoelasticity, rutting resistance and strain recovering ability of asphalt composites were systemati-cally demonstrated. The results showed that the obtained asphalt composites containing 3 wt% warm-mix agents not only exhibited the significantly improved complex shear modulus, rutting factor and recovery percent, but also showed the decreased phase angle and non-recoverable creep compliance, suggesting excellent permanent deformation resistance and high elastic recovery; in addition, the low-temperature properties of resultant asphalt composites might be clearly changed. Moreover, the stiffening effect of the synthesized warm-mix agents was confirmed by the increased amounts of bee structure and glass-transition temperature. This work demonstrates that the catalytic cracking product of waste plastics is an economical yet efficient alternative for tuning structure and performance of asphalt.',\n",

Their structural properties were studied by Infrared Spectroscopy IR and Differential Thermal Analysis DTA. Results from the IR showed that Sb3+ and Bi3+ were responsible for glass network structure, which was supported by the diversification of density rho and molar volume V-m with an increasing amount of Bi2O3. Glass transition temperature T-g, thermal stability, and coefficient of thermal expansion increased after substitution of Bi2O3 for Sb2O3 within the range of 0 mol% to 20 mol%. The water durability decreased and then increased; it could be attributed to the corrosion resistant P-O-Sb bonds.

For this purpose, (SiO2-Al2O3-CaO)-based glass (50-60 wt%)/ceramic (Al2O3 or mullite) composites with nano-hBN (0-10 wt%) addition were investigated. Al2O3 was replaced by mullite to decrease dielectric constant and to match thermal expansion coefficient to Si, and hBN was incorporated to increase thermal conductivity and to decrease dielectric constant. Densification at temperatures <= 900 degrees C was easily achieved for all compositions due to viscous sintering of the glass matrix. hBN did not react chemically with crystalline and amorphous phases, which effectively decreased dielectric constant and increased thermal conductivity. Hence, both mullite and nano-hBN strongly improved dielectric and thermal properties required for the LTCC applications. Dense mullite/glass (55 wt%) base composite with 10 wt% hBN addition was successfully engineered and had comparable dielectric and thermal properties (i.e., 2.3 gcm(-3) after sintering at 900 degrees C, dielectric constant (loss) = 5.13 (0.003) at 5 MHz, thermal conductivity =1.91 Wm(-1) K-1 at 25 degrees C, and thermal expansion coefficient for the base composite =4.75 ppm degrees C-1) with respect to the commercial LTCC products.[GRAPHICS].',\n",

Though physical parameters, such as thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, viscosity, yield stress, and surface tension, of these alloys are broadly known, the surface tension (surface free energy) of the oxide skin remains intangible due to the high yield stress of the oxide skin. In this article, we propose to employ gradually attenuated vibrations to obtain equilibrium shapes, which are analyzed along the lines of the puddle height method. The surface tension of the oxide skin was determined on quartz glass and liquid metal-phobic diamond coating to be around 350-365 mN/m, thus independent of the substrate surface or employed liquid metal (i.e., eutectic Ga-In (EGaIn) and galinstan). The similarity of the surface tension for different alloys was ascribed to the composition of the oxide skin, which predominantly comprises gallium oxides due to thermodynamic constraints. We envision that this method can also be applied to other liquid metal alloys and liquid metal marble systems facilitating modeling, simulation, and optimization processes.',\n",

The structures of these systems were simulated and some physico-chemical parameters were estimated, showing the influence of the material composition. The solution casting process was involved for the composite systems preparation. The filler amount affected the structure of the nanocomposites impacting their properties. Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated certain chemical changes in the nanocomposite structures. Thermal characterization showed that nanocomposite's glass transition temperature domain increase with nanofiller content. Mechanical testing indicated an enhancement of the Young's modulus after reinforcing the polymer. Atomic force microscopy stated the presence of the filler in the polymer matrix, the density of the surface features being higher as filler concentration increased. The force curve spectroscopy supported an intensification of the adhesion force measured between the sample and the tip of the cantilever with the increase of the amount of the filler in the nanocomposite, completing the mechanical tests at nanoscale. The electrical permittivity and conductivity of the nanocomposites were investigated by Broadband dielectric spectroscopy at variable electric field frequency. The results revealed a significant enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the studied composite materials, especially at high filler loadings.\",\n",

The results showed that a wide composition range could be quenched to form BMG when the considerable refractory metal was introduced, although the higher mixing enthalpy of W than Mo between other elements (such as Fe, Cr, C) incited the deterioration of glass forming ability (GFA). The introduction of W significantly improved the thermal stability of the alloy system with glass transition temperature Tg and onset crystallization temperature T-x of Fe36Cr23Mo8W10C15B6Y2 BMG reached 923 K and 972 K, respectively. The W-bearing Fe-based BMGs also exhibited a very high hardness of 1400 HV and Young's modulus of 271 GPa, respectively. The extremely high thermal stability and elastic modulus were mainly derived from the strong chemical bonding between atoms. In addition, the large addition of W reduced the corrosion current density of the original alloy by an order of magnitude, which was mainly due to the formation of WO3 and the increase of MoO2 in the passivation film which inhibit the pit initiation and pit growth.\",\n",

In spite of their well-investigated short-range ordered structures, the relationship between the properties and the medium-range structural features is far from being understood. In this paper, atomistic structures of sodium aluminophosphate (SAP) glasses were reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, experimental methods, including Raman, differential scanning calorimetry, and synchrotron X-ray total scattering, have been applied to characterize the structures of these glasses, together with the measurements of various glass properties, such as the density, glass transition temperature (T-g), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and hardness. Moreover, the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis was performed to correlate the simulated glass structures with the experimentally measured properties. The simulation results reveal that the P-O-P linkages in the glass network are gradually replaced by the P-O-Al linkages with additional alumina to the compositions, which contributes to the property changes of the SAP glass systems. Meanwhile, the long chains in the SAP glasses tend to form ring structures, and the primitive rings are concentrated in the range between 4- and 20-membered rings. Furthermore, QSPR analysis shows that the simulated structures have good correlations with the experimental properties, and the established structure-property model is promising in predicting certain properties of aluminophosphate glass systems.',\n",

From the surface response in terms of penetration, ductility, softening point, glass transition temperature, and mass-loss percentage, the optimum waste engine oil-based rejuvenator had 5% plasticizer, 6.33% antiaging agent, and 7.3% fusogen. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis indicated that the prepared rejuvenator possessed excellent thermostability at 200 degrees C. The optimum dosage of the rejuvenator was determined as 6% by the weight of asphalt binder based on the penetration, ductility, and softening point results. Then, the effects of the rejuvenator on the asphalt binder properties were evaluated through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The binder test results implied that the rejuvenator significantly reduced the glass transition temperature of aged asphalt and restored the chemical composition, which also increased the rheological properties. Subsequently, the effects of the rejuvenator on the asphalt mixture properties were also evaluated through freeze-thaw splitting, beam bending, and dynamic stability tests. The mixture test results showed that the rejuvenator effectively increased the moisture resistance and low-temperature cracking resistance of aged asphalt mixture, which yielded comparable mixture properties with virgin asphalt mixtures.',\n",

The as-prepared samples demonstrated the outstanding mechanical and optical properties. The measured hardness, Young's modulus, and indentation fracture toughness of the high-entropy (R = Gd) glass are 12.58 GPa, 177.9 GPa, and 1.52 MPa.m(0.5), respectively, in which the hardness and Young's modulus exhibit the highest value among the reported oxide glasses. Structural analysis revealed that the excellent mechanical properties are attributed to the large dissociation energies and the high field strength of Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 and the complex interaction between atoms caused by high entropy.\",\n",

The mechanical properties including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, bulk modulus, and shear modulus, along with glass transition temperature, thermal conductivity, relative dielectric constant, and breakdown strength of the four models have been simulated and calculated. The results show that the mechanical properties and the glass transition temperature of PTFE are reduced by the injection of water molecules, whereas the same, along with the thermal conductivity, are improved by incorporating BN nanoparticles. Moreover, thermal conductivity is further improved by the surface grafting of BN nanoparticles. With the increase of temperature, the mechanical properties and the breakdown strength of PTFE decrease gradually, whereas the thermal conductivity increases linearly. The injection of water molecules increases the water content in the PTFE materials, which causes a gradual increase in its relative dielectric constant. This work has shown that this effect is significantly reduced by incorporation of BN nanoparticles. The variation of physical properties for PTFE and its composites under the action of moisture, temperature, and electric fields is of great significance to the study of wet, thermal, and electrical aging tests as well as the life prediction of PTFE cable insulation materials.\""
